Your name is big brother  
You say that you're watching me on the tele,  
Seeing me go nowhere,  
Your name is big brother,  
You say that you're tired of me protesting,  
Children dying everyday,  
My name is nobody  
But I can't wait to see your face inside my door.  
  
Your name is big brother  
You say that you got me all in your notebook,  
Writing it down everyday,  
Your name is I'll see ya,  
I'll change if you vote me in as the pres,  
The President of your soul  
I live in the ghetto,  
You just come to visit me 'round election time.  
  
I live in the ghetto,  
Someday I will move on my feet to the other side,  
My name is secluded, we live in a house the size of a matchbox,  
Roaches live with us wall to wall,  
  
You've killed all our leaders,  
I don't even have to do nothin' to you,  
You'll cause your own country to fall.



He don't know that you been coming around  
He don't know that we been out of bounds  
Things we do are better left unsaid  
You and me can never keep our heads  
What he don't know  
Will never hurt him  
What he don't know  
Is I have changed  
It's just a matter of time  
Till it all comes down down down  
Till he hears  
The stories going round round round  
What he don't know  
What he don't know  
  
Baby, I'm open to your every suggestion  
Nothing you ask is out of the question  
Things I wouldn't do ya got me doin'  
And oh, what I wouldn't do for you  
  
What he don't know  
Will never hurt him  
What he don't know  
Is I have changed  
It's just a matter of time  
Till it all comes down down down  
Till he hears  
The stories going round round round  
What he don't know  
What he don't know  
  
What he don't know  
What he don't know  
What he don't know  
What he don't know



Looking out  
Across the nighttime  
The city winks a sleepless eye  
Hear her voice  
Shake my window  
Sweet seducing sighs  
  
Get me out  
Into the nighttime  
Four walls won't hold me tonight  
If this town  
Is just an apple  
Then let me take a bite  
  
If they say,  
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature  
Why, why, does he do it that way  
If they say,  
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature  
Why, why does he do me that way  
  
Reaching out  
To touch a stranger  
Electric eyes are everywhere  
See that girl  
She knows I'm watching  
She likes the way I stare  
  
If they say,  
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature  
Why, why, does he do me that way  
If they say,  
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature  
Why, why does he do me that way  
  
I like livin' this way  
I like lovin' this way  
  
(That way) Why why  
(That way) Why why  
  
Looking out  
Across the morning  
Where the city's heart begins to beat  
Reaching out  
I touch her shoulder  
I'm dreaming of the street  
  
If they say,  
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature  
Why, why, does he do me that way  
If they say,  
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature  
Why, why does he do me that way



Merry Christmas (Slade Cover)  
  
are you hanging up your stocking on your wall

does he ride a red nosed reindeer  
does he turn up on his sleigh  
do the farries keep him sober for a day  
  
so here it is merry christmas  
everybodies having fun  
look to the future now  
it's only just begun  
  
are you waiting for your family to arrive  
are you sure you've got the room to spare inside  
does your granny always tell you  
that the old songs are the best  
and shes up and rock 'n' rolling with rest  
  
so here it is merry christmas  
everybodies having fun  
look to the future now  
it's only just begun  
  
what will your daddy do when he sees your moma kissing santa, ahaa  
  
are you hanging up your stocking on your wall  
are you hoping that the snow will start to fall  
do you ride on down the hillside  
in a boggy you have made  
when you land upon your head  
then you will say  
  
so here it is merry christmas  
everybodies having fun  
look to the future now  
it's only just begun  
(repeat chorus X4)



Can't help it, now, baby  
You better make your face get out of here, quick  
Maybe your ass was getting, aah, too rich  
It ain't like we ain't never seen this thing before  
And if it turns you then around  
Then you better hit the door  
But I know, it's just a temporary thing  
Ooh, yeah, it's just a temporary thing  
  
You've read too many books  
You've seen too many plays  
And it's things like this, that turn you away  
Hey, hey, now, now, look, ha, look  
Hey look, hey look, hey look, you better think about it twice  
I know that your good breeding makes it seem not so nice  
It's just a temporary thing  
Aha, aha, aha, it's just a temporary thing  
  
Where's the number, where's the dime and where's the phone  
I feel like a stranger  
I guess you want to go back home  
Your mother, your father, your brother  
I guess you wouldn't agree with me  
But I don't give two shits, they're no better than me  
  
Aha, it's just a temporary thing, oh yeah, been there before  
Just a temporary thing, oh yeah, been there before  
Ahh, bitch, get of my... temporary thing  
Get out, it's just a temporary thing...



I'm leaving to search for something new,  
Leaving everything I ever knew.  
A hundred years in the sunshine  
Hasn't taught me all there is to know.  
  
In the valley, we will gather there,  
Helpless in our surrender.  
Tomorrow the plow becomes the sword  
Make us stronger in our danger.  
  
Time will pass away,  
Time will guard our secret.  
I'll return again  
To fight another day.  
  
[Repeat x3]  
I'd have to be a warrior  
A slave I couldn't be  
A soldier and a conqueror,  
Fighting to be free



Yeah! Yeah!  
  
You left the lights on yeah!  
This is what you ran  
I wanna see you naked baby  
I wanna take you to bed  
  
I said it, said it with love  
Didn't you notice? It was  
Sealed with a kiss!  
(Hough!) Yeah! Yeah!  
  
Take it how I feel it, uh!  
  
Read about me in the papers  
And what's pretty is too  
Baby  
Now I'm coming for you!  
  
Said it, said it with love  
Didn't you notice? It was  
Sealed with a kiss!  
(Hough!) Yeah!  
  
Take it how I feel it, uh!  
  
Uuuuh Ooooh  
Uuuuh  
Hey! Hey!  
Uuuuh Ooooh  
Ooooh  
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  
Hey!  
  
Said it, said it with love  
Didn't you notice? It was  
Sealed with a kiss!  
(Hough!) Yeah! Yeah!  
  
Sealed With A Kiss!  
(Hough!) Yeah! Yeah!

Sealed with a kiss!

Sealed with a kiss!  
Yeah! Yeah!  
  
(Hough!)  
  
Sealed With A Kiss!  
Yeah! Yeah!



Too many Florence Nightingales  
Not enough Robin Hoods  
Too many halos not enough heroes  
Coming up with the goods  
  
So you though you'd like to change the world  
Decided to stage a jumble sale  
For the poor, for the poor  
  
It's a waste of time if you know what they mean  
Try shaking a box in front of the Queen  
'Cause her purse is fat and bursting at the seams  
It's a waste of time if you know what they mean  
  
Too many hands in too many pockets  
Not enough hands on hearts  
Too many ready to call it a day  
Before the day starts  
  
So you thought you'd like to see them healed  
Got blue Peter to stage an appeal  
For the poor, for the poor  
  
It's a waste of time if you know what they mean  
Try shaking a box in front of the Queen  
'Cause her purse is fat and bursting at the seams  
It's a waste of time if you know what they mean  
  
Flag Day, Flag Day, Flag Day



Innocent, that's my way  
Don't know where I am  
Catch my breath, can't think straight  
Got to make a plan  
  
But I get butterflies  
Water in my eyes  
  
'cause I'm fragile when I hear your name  
Fragile when you call  
This could be the nearest thing to love  
And I'm fragile when I hear you speak  
Fragile feeling small  
This could be the closest thing to love  
  
Shake and sweat, wipe my brow  
Scared of what's to come  
Lie awake, toss and turn  
Am I the only one  
  
But I get butterflies  
Water in my eyes  
  
'cause I'm fragile when I hear your name  
Fragile when you call  
This could be the nearest thing to love  
And I'm fragile when I hear you speak  
Fragile feeling small  
This could be the closest thing to love  
  
But I get butterflies  
Water in my eyes  
When I think of you  
I could break in to  
  
'cause I'm fragile when I hear your name  
Fragile when you call  
This could be the nearest thing to love  
And I'm fragile when I hear you speak  
Fragile feeling small  
This could be the closest thing to love



I've got a livin' that's rough, a future that's tough  
You know what I mean  
Blankers and boasters, all the bluffers and posers  
I'm not into that scene  
  
You can tell me that I got no class  
Look around, you'll see who's laughin' last  
Don't give me speeches 'cause they're oh so droll  
Leave me alone, let me rock and roll  
  
Got an itchin' to rock, a hate for small talk  
I'm funny that way  
Got my sights on the stars, won't get that far  
But I'll try anyway  
I just like to please, don't like to tease  
I'm easy like that  
Don't like long rests, I must confess  
I'm an impatient cat  
  
I do the best that I can  
I'm just what I am  
I do the best I can  
Well, I know what I am  
  
Rock and rollin's a scream, makin' millions my dream  
Well, I do that a lot  
I'll just give it a try, won't let good times pass me by  
They're all I've got



Mad Professor Blyth is working on his pet invention  
To dematerialise himself into the fourth dimension  
He's got his mind set on illusion  
To find the secrets of diffusion  
Conclusion: he disappeared  
  
Tried it on his cat one grey night when it was foggy  
Never got it back Oh what happened to his Moggy  
He's got his mind set on illusion  
To find the secrets of diffusion  
Conclusion: he's disappeared  
  
All the kids around about his neighbourhood  
Used to laugh at him and call him names  
Silly old bat freaky four-eyes  
Sort of things they used to shout  
He can't hear them now  
  
He's disappeared  
Colleagues at the lab  
They all thought that he was crazy  
Don't know where he's at  
His formulas to them are hazy  
  
He had his mind set on illusion  
He found the secrets of diffusion  
Conclusion: he's disappeared



Well honey did I ever tell you just how wonderful you are  
Every time you hold me I'll be floatin' with the stars in the sky  
I wonder why I guess it's love love love love  
Well baby did I ever tell you that you're the greatest guy  
Honey are you with me when I look into your eyes  
I wonder why I wonder why I guess it's love love love love  
Well now don't you know you send me where I never been before  
I just want to let you know I love you so  
Well I like to hear you talkin' but you're wastin' your time  
You're not playin' nothin' that I don't already know  
Well baby did I ever tell you that you got what it takes  
And every time you tuck me in your arms I shake  
I wonder why I wonder why I guess it's love love love love  
[ steel ]  
Well now don't you know you send me...  
I guess it's love love love love I guess it's love love love love  
  
  



Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Moving is breathing and breathing is life  
Stopping is dying  
You'll be alright  
Life is a hammer waiting to drop  
Drifting the shallows and the rowing won't stop  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Can't see the sky, nothing's on the horizon  
Can't feel my hands and the water keeps risin'  
Can't fall asleep 'cause I wake up dead  
I just keep polling, I just keep rowing  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Rowing is living and living is hard  
But living beats losing all that we are  
All that we know of, and all that we feel  
All we remember, imagine the real  
All we remember, imagine the real  
  
Hey!  
  
I heard an echo but the answer had changed  
From the word I remembered  
That I started out sayin'  
Living is cheating if you're not pulling oars  
The current is leaving  
I'll get mine  
You get yours  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Hey!  
  
Rowing is bleeding, bleeding is breathing  
Breathing is feeling, running, and freezing  
We're getting dirty but I started out clean  
  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on polling and  
Keep on polling and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing and  
Keep on rowing  
Keep on rowing  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row  
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing  
I just keep on polling, gotta row



Even though it's been so long, my love for you keeps going strong.  
I remember the things that we used to do  
A kiss in the rain till the sun shined through.  
I tried to deny it, but I'm still in love with you.  
  
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy,  
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day.  
I miss you like crazy, I miss you, baby.  
Love like ours will never end, just touch me and we're there again.  
  
I can see the love shining in your eyes,  
And it comes as such a sweet surprise.  
It seems believing is worth the wait,  
So hold me and tell me it's not too late.  
We're so good together, we're starting forever now.  
  
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy,  
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day.  
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy.  
No matter what I say or do, there's just no getting over you.  
  
Just one night, and we'll have to find the feelings like we used to do.  
Hold on tight, and whatever comes our way, we're gonna make it through.  
It seems to believing is worth the wait,  
So hold me and tell me it's not too late.  
We're so good together, we're starting forever now.  
  
And I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy.  
No matter what I say or do, there's just no getting over you.  
And I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy.

Gut, dass es Freunde gibt, und Musik, die man nie vergisst  
Gut ist alles, was jemand liebt, es ist gut, dass du bei mir bist  
  
  
Da ist ein Mann, der lebt fuer seine Rosen  
Sie sind das Glueck fuer ihn, schoen, dass Blumen blueh'n  
Und eine Dame malt jeden Tag ein Bild  
Nur aus Freude dran, schoen, dass sie das kann  
Und da bin ich und denke an uns zwei und hoere unser Lied  
Und habe etwas, das mir bleibt, was immer auch geschieht

Da geht ein Mann hinter seinem Pflug  
Er lebt von seiner Erde, gut, dass sie ihn naehrt  
Ein Maedchen liegt am Strand von Monte Carlo  
Die Sonne streichelt sie, schoen, dass Sonne waermt

Und habe etwas, das mir bleibt, was immer auch geschieht

Hey yo Violent J, what's up?  
It's Christmas, time for a slaughter  
Maybe your wife, maybe your daughter  
It's midnight, I land my sleigh  
Make way for jolly St. J  
Climb down the chimny, for the murder  
Dressed as the fat man everyones heard of  
Shimy down, shimy down, what the fuck?  
Somebody help me, I'm stuck

Oh fuck, it's the real St. Nick  
And he musta been taken a shit  
But regardless, I better move quick, now  
So I jumped him, Santa's no joke  
Fucked around got my damn neck broke  
He strap, he shot, he didn't miss  
(Gunshots and ho ho ho)

And my buttcrack, toes, and elbows  
My nutz is froze, fuck you hoes  
So I made a friend like me, a snow man  
He was down with the clown like a blow man  
Had a hat and eyes outta charcoal  
And a pipe, we fill it with indow  
Me and him sang songs in the snowflakes  
He ate snowballs, I ate cornflakes  
And we both would freeze are ballz off  
I was there every time his head fallz off  
I put it back on for him with a smile  
He was my boy, made from a snow pile  
Then the storm came, a blizzard  
Snow, wind, ice, a blizzard  
We pulled through we hid in an alley  
The next day it was like sunny valley  
He was meltin I was just fine  
He got pissed and pulled out a nine  
"If I'm gonna die you should come with me  
'cause we boyz" (gunshot) It hit me  
Damn I'm dying, I'm dead he got his wish  
And all I got was another red christmas  
"Sighlent night, violent fight  
Now I'm dead, one to the head  
Christmas this year seemed so whack"

(Dolly Parton)  
I cry awake at night and hug my pillow  
And pray that I will die before I wake  
No such luck  
Another day of cryin'  
Don't know how much more my old heart can break  
Flooded with these memories and emotions  
The tears like rain keep on falling down  
They say that I'll forget  
But my face is just as wet  
As it was the day you left this town  
Drowning in this endless, endless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
It's relentless and I'm defenseless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
I can't believe that I can talk about it  
I never thought I'd live to see this day  
But a broken heart won't kill you  
You just want to die  
But you have to go on livin' anyway  
I feel it through and through  
And I've never been so blue  
And I cried a river over you  
Drowning in this endless, endless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
It's relentless and I'm defenseless  
Drowning in an endless stream of tears  
Oh, I'm drowning in this endless, endless  
Drowning in this endless, endless  
Drowning in this endless, endless  
Drowning in this endless stream of tears

'Cause I've been tryna work it out, ow  
Good weed, white wine, uh

Okay, away we go  
Only thing we have on is the radio-oh  
Let it play, say you gotta leave  
But I know you wanna stay  
You are waiting on the traffic jam to finish girl  
The things we could do in twenty minutes girl  
Say my name, say my name  
Wear it out, its getting hot, crack a window, air it out

Knows how to make me want it  
But boy you stay up on it  
You got that something  
That keeps me so off balance  
Baby you're a challenge  
Lets explore your talent

Every door you enter, I will let you in

She wound the thread around the pieces of, my broken heart  
Had left me to believe  
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave  
  
The starry nights without a fear of heights  
I can't recall, but I learned after all  
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall  
  
As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn  
As your sweet dreams dissolve, I'll crash and burn  
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe  
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me  
  
A blissful way she whispered in my ear  
Before she left, had me so convinced  
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave  
  
And Juliet's romantic balcony  
Wears out the wall, and I learned after all  
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall  
  
As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn  
As your sweet dreams dissolve, I'll crash and burn  
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe  
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me  
  
I feel alone  
I hope my ghost, never leaves  
'Cause when I'm home  
Your painful memory, is always haunting me  
  
As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn  
As your sweet dreams dissolve, I'll crash and burn  
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe  
As you stir in your sleep, the thought is killing to me  
  
When I see you around, my eyes get wide  
When you race through my mind, I die inside  
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe  
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me  
  
I hope you think of me, I hope you think of me



I can see it in your eyes, you're angry  
Regret got shit on what you're feeling now  
Mad cause he ain't like me  
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me  
All the care I would take, all the love that we made  
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you  
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia  
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man  
Yeah I said it, bitch I'm the man  
Don't you forget it  
The way you walk, that's me  
The way you talk, that's me  
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?  
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me  
And the voice in your ear, that's me  
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it  
First I made you who you are, then I made it  
And you're wasted with your ladies  
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded  
  
[Chorus]  
Take a shot for me, ooh  
Take a shot for me, ooh  
Take a shot for me  
A shot for me  
A shot for me  
  
Okay look, I'm honest  
Girl I can't lie, I miss you  
You and the music were the only things that I commit to  
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you  
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you  
She says I know you changed, I never see you  
Cause you're always busy doing things  
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things  
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things  
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen  
The men are jealous and the women all in competition  
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret  
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"  
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer  
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover  
This is one I know you hated when you heard it  
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
May your neighbors respect you  
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you  
And heaven accept you



Genetic engineering  
Could create the perfect race  
Could create an unknown life-force  
That could us exterminate  
  
Introducing worker clone  
As our subordinated slave  
His expertise proficiency  
Will surely dig our grave  
  
It's so tempting  
Will biologists resist  
When he becomes the creator  
Will he let us exist  
  
Bionic man is jumping  
Through the television set  
He's about to materialize  
And guess who's coming next



If you're sick and disease stricken  
The system's got a cure that you're not getting  
Getting unless you're one of the elite  
And that's the only way that your illness can be beat  
With a nice insurance policy their eyes will light up  
These rich bastard doctors are shady and corrupt  
  
To make a million dollars off of someone's pain  
Those heartless fuckin' bastards have no fuckin' shame  
Medicines and treatments they should all be free  
But that will never happen in our society  
  
If your broke, unhappy they take you in  
If your heavily insured you should see their fuckin' grin  
As you pop your pills, they pop their champaigne  
As your paying off your debt, they're boarding a plane  
Your misfortune pays for their vacation  
And the million dollar homes they resign in  
They don't care about your health, only their wallets  
Their greed is a disease and we gotta stop it  
  
Greed is a disease



Baby, take me, baby, take me, baby I'm drivin' maybe  
Baby take me...  
Take it or leave it on a Saturday night  
If what you see is what you get then gimme a bite  
Here comes the ladies, they're so insecure  
Leave it to the boys and the fool on the hill  
Hey baby, be no jock, no third degree  
Oh, jailbait  
Play the foolin', play the pawn  
Wake up baby I'm out the door, jailbait  
I'm believin', someone talkin  
Can't let go, got the hold, oh jailbait  
What it is that you believe  
What you got, got up your sleeve, oh  
Jailbait, jailbait, jailbait, jailbait  
  
Take it, leave it, roll the dice  
You're hot as hell, I'm cold as ice, oh jailbait  
Tell your daddy how you do me  
Put the woodshed, do it to me, jailbait  
Whatchya see in daddy's eyes  
Check the voice, ain't no surprise  
Jailbait, jailbait, jailbait, jailbait, jailbait, jailbait  
Do me, do you, tell me, would you  
See me, me too, do me, do you  
I ain't complainin bitch's brew  
Girls in love I never knew she jailbait  
Steep the chase, cold sweatin  
Stick your feet up  
Jailbait, jailbait, jailbait  
Jailbait, jailbait, jailbait



Just one more moment, that's all that's needed,  
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing  
Time to be honest, this time I'm pleading,  
Please don't dwell on it, 'cause I didn't mean it  
  
I can't believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground,  
But it doesn't matter 'cause I made it up, forgive me now  
Everyday I spend away, my soul's inside out,  
Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now, somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
By now you know that I'd come for you  
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you  
But only if you told me to  
And I'd fight for you  
I'd lie, it's true  
Give my life for you  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
I was blindfolded, but now I'm seeing,  
My mind was closing, now I'm believing  
I finally know just what it means to let someone in,  
To see the side of me that no one does, or ever will  
So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone,  
I'd search forever just to bring you home,  
Here and now, this I vow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
No matter what gets in my way  
As long as there's still life in me  
No matter what, remember  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
Yes I'd come for you, no one but you,  
Yes I'd come for you, but only if you told me to  
  
And I'd fight for you,  
I'd lie, it's true  
Give my life for you,  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
No matter what gets in my way,  
As long as there's still life in me  
No matter what, remember, you know I'd always come for you  
I'd crawl across this world for you,  
Do anything you want me to  
No matter what, remember, you know I'd always come for you  
You know I'd always come for you.



Yo, yo, I wanna be close to you  
  
Anytime that you go,  
Girl I'm gonna miss you so  
I wanna be close to you, close to you  
With my head in the clouds  
Oh my heart is crying loud  
Oh I wanna be close to you, close to you  
And I know, you are my angel  
But angels are not flying low  
And I know, oh you are my angel  
And I'll never let you go  
  
A summer in December  
Love we just remember  
A summer love in winter  
I always will remember  
  
And the way you look tonight,  
Make the stars shine bright  
I wanna he close to you, close to you  
Every step on my way, every word I will say  
I wanna be close to you, close to you  
And for me, it was like heaven  
Everything will turn out fine  
And for me, it's like a heaven  
Baby give it some more time



Is it an horrific dream  
Am I sinking fast  
Could a person be so mean  
As to laugh and laugh  
On my own  
Could you ease my load  
Could you see my Pain  
Could you please explain  
The Hurting  
  
Could you understand a child  
When he cries in Pain  
Could you give him all he needs  
Or do you feel the same  
All along  
You've been told you're wrong  
When you felt it right  
And you're left to fight  
The hurting  
  
Get in line with the things you know  
Feel the Pain  
Feel the sorrow  
Touch the hurt and don't let go  
Get in line with the things you know  
Learn to cry  
Like a baby  
Then the hurting won't come back



[Verse 1]  
What do you got?  
Mass produced in somewhere hot  
You'll have to go on the Underground  
To get things done here  
And then you have  
[?] service done  
This is a place to come to, or, well, it was  
I know a hot spot  
Crossing on the guillotine  
  
[Chorus]  
And if you have nobody left to rely on  
I'll hold you in my arms and let you drift  
It's got to be that time again  
And you, you will be over soon again  
  
[Verse 2]  
So get yourself up, get past [?] on your way  
There's nothing to be ashamed of  
Taking off again  
The 514 to East Grinstead  
You've set me off  
[?]  
And talking types will let us down  
Talk, talk on your arse all night  
You wanna be there  
  
[Bridge]  
Step inside the tarmac ride  
To the land that time forgot  
Oh, we're just gonna go there  
Cracks inside the tarmac ride  
To the land that crime forgot, oh no  
  
[Outro]  
And if you have nobody left to rely on  
I'll hold you in my arms and let you drift  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Lonesome Street  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Lonesome Street  
Going down to Lonesome Street  
Lonesome Street



The sky is crying,  
Can you see the tears roll down the street.  
The sky is crying,  
Can you see the tears roll down the street.  
I've been looking for my baby  
And I've been wondering where can she be  
  
I saw my baby early one morning  
She was walking on down the street  
I saw my baby early one morning  
She was walking on down the street  
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad  
It made my poor heart skip a beat  
  
I got a real, real fine feeling  
That my baby she don't love me no more  
I got a real, real fine feeling  
That my baby she don't love me no more  
You know the sky's been crying  
Can see you see the tears roll down my door



Wishing never got us what we needed  
So we waited for our salvation to arrive  
Then it took everything that we loved  
And it let us alive  
  
I hear you call  
And I promise to you  
One day, some day  
The pain will go  
  
Solitary movement meant for two  
Can you hear the loneliness in silent cries  
If you take everything that I love  
Leave me to die  
  
I hear you call  
And I promise to you  
One day, some day  
The pain will go  
  
If you take everything that I love  
And you leave here,  
Leave me alive  
If you take everything thet I love  
And I'm standing here  
Waiting to die  
  
I hear you call  
And I promise to you  
One day, some day  
The pain will go



If you hear this message, wherever you stand  
I'm calling every woman, calling every man  
We're the generation  
We can't afford to wait  
The future started yesterday and we're already late  
  
We've been looking for a song to sing  
Searched for a melody  
Searched for someone to lead  
We've been looking for the world to change  
If you feel the same  
Then go on and say  
  
If you're out there  
Sing along with me  
If you're out there  
I'm dying to believe that you're out there  
Stand up and say it loud  
If you're out there  
Tomorrow's starting now  
Now, now  
  
No more broken promises  
No more call to war  
Unless it's love and peace that we're really fighting for  
We can destroy hunger  
We can conquer hate  
Put down the arms and raise your voice  
We're joining hands today  
  
Oh I was looking for a song to sing  
I searched for a leader  
But the leader was me  
We were looking for the world to change  
We can be heroes  
Just go on and say  
  
If you're out there  
Sing along with me  
If you're out there  
I'm dying to believe that you're out there  
Stand up and say it loud  
If you're out there  
Tomorrow's starting now  
Now, now  
  
Oh now, now  
  
If you're ready we can shake the world  
Believe again  
It starts within  
We don't have to wait for destiny  
We should be the change that we want to see  
  
If you're out there  
If you're out there  
And you're ready now  
Say it loud  
Scream it out  
  
If you're out there  
Sing along with me  
If you're out there  
I'm dying to believe that you're out there  
Stand up and say it loud  
If you're out there  
Tomorrow's starting now  
  
If you're out there  
If you're out there  
If you're out there  
  
If you hear this message, wherever you stand  
I'm calling every woman, calling every man  
We're the generation  
We can't afford to wait  
The future started yesterday and we're already late



They call you Jezebel  
Whenever we walk in  
You're going straight to hell  
For wanted acts of sin - they say,  
And that I'll have to pay  
But I need you just this way  
  
They call you Jezebel  
For what you like to wear  
You're morally unwell  
They say you never care for me  
But what the fail to see is that your games are the key  
  
Open their eyes to the beauty  
Open their hearts to the fun  
Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone  
  
They call you Jezebel  
Whenever men walk by  
They say that they can tell  
The longing in your eyes is real  
And how you really feel  
But they can't see your appeal  
  
Jezebel



Hands across the table while the lights are low  
Though you hush your lips, your finger tips  
Tell me what I want to know  
Hands across the table meet so tenderly  
And they say in their little way  
That you belong to me  
Hands across the table while the lights are low  
Though you hush your lips, your finger tips  
Tell me all I want to know  
Hands across the table meet so tenderly  
And they say in their little way  
That you belong to me  



Oh my love  
If I had my way then all your dreams  
Would come true  
Oh my love  
All your dreams and all the world  
Just for you  
Oh my love  
If I had my way  
This for you  
  
Spread yourself across my lips  
And I spoon you in  
The sweetest thing in all the world  
Oh I want more  
There is no place I'd rather be than here with you  
Under the sun, the pouring rain, all the sky for you  
  
Oh my love  
If I had my way  
This for you  
Oh my love  
Make your belly full  
And all your dreams to come true



Hello,  
  
This is devo  
We would like  
to say Things go both ways  
New ideas stupid moves  
Nightmares or dreams come true  
Mucho work minus play  
Tension mounts in a twisted face  
Dark clouds in the crystal ball  
Tension mounts in a foreign place  
The screw turns someone calls  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Time out for fun!  
Time out for fun!  
  
So you're living under the gun  
Circumstances have you on the run  
A doctor frowns you feel bad  
Take this you've just been had!  
  
Don't you lose it now listen to us  
Everything's going to be all right  
Take a break take some time  
Everything's going to be all right  
Don't you lose it remember to take  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you lose it now listen to us  
Everything's going to be all right  
Take a break take some time  
Everything's going to be all right  
Don't you lose it remember to take  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
So your life has just begun  
Somebody else is saying that it's done  
Nurses whisper others grin  
Something's funny at your expense again  
  
Don't you lose it now listen to us  
Everything's going to be all right  
Take a break take some time  
Everything's going to be all right  
Don't you lose it remember to take  
  
[Chorus]



How hard is it for me to wait for you  
See you in the next one have a good time  
Could be a lifetime before I see you again  
See you in the next one have a good time  
  
Eyes they open wide  
Eyes they open wide  
I like the way  
It was hate the way it is now  
  
Lack of time and a wasted week end  
You wore your lies like a filmstar  
  
Eyes they open wide  
Eyes they open wide  
I like the way it was  
Hate the way it is now



Just a fraction of your love  
Fills the air  
And I fall in love with you  
All over again, woo woo woo  
You're the light that feeds the sun  
In my world  
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl  
Out of all the things in life that I could fear  
The only thing that would hurt me,  
Is if you weren't here, whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation  
You understand what I'm sayin'?  
Girl, without you I'm lost  
Can't face this compass at heart  
Between me and love,  
You're the common denominator  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Common denominator  
Oh, yeah, woa  
  
Before you're love was low  
Playing girls was my high  
We chase the game that would put  
My cot in the side, aye  
When broken hearts rise up to say,  
Love is a lie  
You and I would stand to be love's reply  
  
Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah  
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here, whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't imagine life without your touch  
And every kiss that you give, can fill me up  
And to all the heart aching  
Jealous females hatin'  
Imma hold it down for you, you  
You, woah, oh, woah  
You're the common denominator  
Oh yeah woah  
  
I don't wanna go back  
I don't want to go back  
To just being one half of the equation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just a fraction of your love fills the air  
And I fall in love with you all over again



I never wanted to be  
A man of mystery  
My life's an open book  
by James Joyce and Agatha Christie  
  
Sometimes I get confused  
Somewhere around page two  
I live the perfect crime  
And crime pays more than it used to  
  
They're checkin' the evidence  
May be come charges pressed  
The only one they got me on  
is some misdemeanor craziness  
  
(CHORUS)  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
If they solve my life if they find me out  
Never thought to keep all I have found  
I hae had my fun If It All Falls Down  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I hve had my fund I have bought a few rounds  
And been out on the town way out on the town  
Way way way out If It All Falls Down  
  
Never wanted to be  
A part of history  
I have my days in the sun  
A beach bum a man for all sea sides  
Guidance counselor said  
Your scores are anti-heroic  
Computer recommends  
Hard-drinking calypso poet  
  
Studied life at sea  
Studied life in bars  
Never passed my S.A.T.'s  
So I thought I'd study extra hard  
  
(CHROUS)  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I have learned my trade from the inside out  
I can strum real hard I can play real loud  
I can charm a crowd If It All Falls Down  
  
If It all Falls Down falls down falls down  
I can warm a crowd I can make them shout  
I can juggle verbs adverbs and nouns  
I can make them dance till they all fall down  
We had plenty of doctors  
We had plenty of lawyers  
We had people to make us things  
We had people to sell us those things  
We didn't have enough room for those things  
We build lots of self storage  
Calypso poet shortage  
Calypso poet shortage  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I'll have filled that void from city to town  
I'll have spent my money and taken my bows  
I'll have had my fun If It All Falls Down  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
If they solve my life if they find me out  
Never thought to keep all I have found  
I have had my fun If It All Falls Down  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I can charm a crowd till they snake danced round  
With calypso beat down island sound  
I can make them dance till they all fall down  
  
If It All Falls Down falls down falls down  
I can charm a crowd I can make them shout  
I can juggle verbs adverbs and nouns  
I can make them dance till they all fall down



Sgt. Baker is my name  
I'm gonna teach you how to play the game  
Of warfare  
Suddenly it appears to me  
You got a bit much dignity  
For your own good, boy  
Yes sir, yes sir.  
  
I will rape your personality  
Pummel you with my own philosophy  
Strip you of your self-integrity  
To make you all a bit like me  
I said right, left, right, left  
  
Sgt. Baker here again  
And if you calls me Puddin' Tame  
I'll stomp you down, boy  
Steers and Queers  
Steers and Queers where you come  
From there's just steers and queers  
And you ain't got no horns, boy  
Yes sir, yes sir  
  
I will rape your personality  
Pummel you with my own philosophy  
Strip you of your self-integrity  
To make you all a bit like me  
I said right, left, right, left, right, left



The Telephone  
Another night of too much cough syrup  
I'm awakened by the incessant ringing of a telephone  
I still have dreams caked in the corners of my eyes  
And my mouth is dry and tastes shitty  
  
Again the ringing  
  
Slowly I bustle out of bed  
The remnants of an erection still lingering in my shorts  
Like a bothersome guest  
  
Again the ringing  
  
Carefully I abscond to the bathroom  
As to not display my manhood to others  
There I make the perfunctory morning faces  
Which always seem to precede my daily contribution  
To the once-blue toilet water  
That I always enjoy making green  
  
Again the ringing  
  
I shake twice like most others  
And I'm annoyed by the dribble that always seems to remain  
Causing a small acreage of wetness on the front of my briefs  
I slowly languidly, lazily, crazily,  
Stumble into the den  
Where my father smokes his guitars  
I mean cigars  
In his easy chair  
I know all about easy chairs  
And then I sing a song for my friends  
  
Jesus is my boyfriend  
Jesus is my boyfriend  
You can't have him  
Because jesus is my boyfriend  
  
Ringing ringing  
Dang it goddamn motherfucking son-of-a-bitch is ringing  
I walk into the kitchen and I  
Stare blankly at that shrieking plastic bastard  
Since it keeps ringing I know it's her  
And since it keeps ringing she knows it's me  
  
We are the world, we are the children  
We are the ones who make a darker day  
So let's start killing  
There's a choice you're making  
We're sparing our own lives  
It's true we'll make a darker day  
Just you and me



Well, I could search from now to the end of the time  
Never find another you  
I'm so glad because I know you're mine  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Well, I believe, my love, that you're one of the kind  
For there's no one else like you  
You're the light of my life, so let it shine  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Well, I find happiness is lovin' you  
And I'll do my best to make your dreams come true  
Now I will follow you to the end of the earth  
For my place will be with you  
Well, I have taken you for better or worse  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Well, I find happiness is lovin' you  
And I'll do my best to make your dreams come true  
Days of man-and-wife-time are precious few  
I will spend them all with you  
Then beyond forever I'll wait for you  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Mm, mm, mm, mm  
Well, you're the light of my life, so let it shine  
Shine on me my whole life through  
Well, you're the light of my life, so let it shine  
I need someone like you



You look out that window  
For someone you know  
But it all looks the same and time and again  
It hurts you so  
You wonder if always  
You'll stand on your own  
But hear in your mind, you'll get through this time  
You're not alone  
  
When time seems so lonely  
And your day seems too long  
You wonder if you will ever get through  
And still be strong  
With eyes full of sadness  
You stand on your own  
It tears you apart, but you know in your heart  
You're not alone  
  
Coast to coast and land to land  
We're together hand in hand  
Coast to coast and land to land...  



Only a woman can take away your cold hard chill  
Break your heart and make you love her still  
Leave you thirsty when you've had your fill  
  
Only a woman can sit you high up on a throne  
Make you feel so damn alone  
Leave you begging baby come back home  
  
And it's only till she's gone  
Could you see that you were wrong  
  
'Cause the seasons change and people come and go  
But when love is fate best hold that woman close  
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door  
'Cause that's your woman  
That's all I know  
  
Only a woman can make you fly so high you wanna touch the sun  
When your wings melt and you come undone  
Catches you when you fall, she's the only one  
  
She steals your heart just like a thief  
Makes you lay roses at your feet  
But you know to kiss the rose, the thorns will make you bleed  
  
And it's only till she's gone  
Could you see that you were wrong  
  
'Cause the seasons change and people come and go  
But when love is fate best hold that woman close  
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door  
'Cause that's your woman  
That's all I know  
  
You thank God you found her  
can't live your life without her  
And every little thing about her is all you need  
All you need  
  
'Cause the seasons change and people come and go  
But when love is fate best hold that woman close  
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door  
'Cause that's your woman  
That's all I know, only a woman  
Only a woman



Come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Then home is way too far away  
  
Tv light of blue and white  
Just can't fall asleep at night  
Move over to the space where you should be  
Even half way seem so far  
Over mountains and diamond stars  
Everybody has their own way home  
  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Home is way too far away  
  
All my life I've dreamed of love  
Never thought it would hurt this much  
To kiss goodbye and wait for your return  
So I'll be strong and hold on to  
A picture and a thought of you  
Getting all the love that you deserve  
  
So come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Home is way too far away  
  
If home is where you are  
Then home is way too far away



Halls of justice painted green  
Money talking  
Power wolves beset your door  
Hear them stalking  
Soon you'll please their appetite  
They devour  
Hammer of justice crushes you  
Overpower  
  
The ultimate in vanity  
Exploiting their supremacy  
I can't believe the things you say  
I can't believe  
I can't believe the price you pay  
Nothing can save you  
  
Justice is lost  
Justice is raped  
Justice is gone  
Pulling your strings  
Justice is done  
Seeking no truth  
Winning is all  
Find it so grim  
So true  
So real  
  
Apathy their stepping stone  
So unfeeling  
Hidden deep animosity  
So deceiving  
Through your eyes their light burns  
Hoping to find  
Inquisition sinking you  
With prying minds  
  
The ultimate in vanity  
Exploiting their supremacy  
I can't believe the things you say  
I can't believe  
I can't believe the price you pay  
Nothing can save you  
  
Justice is lost  
Justice is raped  
Justice is gone  
Pulling your strings  
Justice is done  
Seeking no truth  
Winning is all  
Find it so grim  
So true  
So real  
  
Lady justice has been raped  
Truth assassin  
Rolls of red tape seal your lips  
Now you're done in  
Their money tips her scales again  
Make your deal  
Just what is truth?I cannot tell  
Cannot feel  
  
The ultimate in vanity  
Exploiting their supremacy  
I can't believe the things you say  
I can't believe  
I can't believe the price we pay  
Nothing can save you  
  
Justice is lost  
Justice is raped  
Justice is gone  
Pulling your strings  
Justice is done  
Seeking no truth  
Winning is all  
Find it so grim  
So true  
So real  
Seeking no truth  
Winning is all  
Find it so grim  
So true  
So real



One and the same, one and the same  
I wish I could see beyond the filthy blue horizon, see what lies ahead of me  
Perhaps I'd see the path of my own destruction  
And avoid my destiny, she said Heaven and Hell is one and the same boy  
She told me Heaven and Hell, boy, was one and the same  
We all meet somewhere in the middle  
She told me Heaven and Hell, boy, is one and the same  
I said it can't be true  
  
I wish I could touch you in some totally new fashion  
Who are you girl, I'm a man, now I can't guarantee your complete satisfaction  
So I'm gonna do you the very best way I can  
  
She said Heaven and Hell is one and the same, boy  
She told me Heaven and Hell, boy, is one and the same  
We all meet somewhere in the middle  
She told me Heaven and Hell, boy, is one and the same  
I said it can't be true  
  
Wish I could find some time to stop and smell the roses  
My landlord won't let me be, my head is full of paranoia  
New roses, tryin' to consume my identity  
  
She said heaven and hell is one and the same, boy  
She told me heaven and hell, boy, is one and the same  
We all meet somewhere in the middle, yes we do  
She told me heaven and hell, boy, is one and the same  
I said it can't be true, it just can't be true  
  
Children grow and women produce and men go work and some go stealin' (repeat
X1)  
Heaven and Hell (children grow and women produce), here on Earth (and men go
work and some go stealin') X7



How many times must I tell you  
I will not pretend  
Will it ever end  
Guess there's a need to condemn  
What I defend  
  
Say what you will  
In for the kill  
I'll stand my ground  
At any sacrifice  
  
Tearing my heart out  
And serve it to you on a plate  
Bitter to the taste  
One bite is all you can take  
the rest's thrown away  
  
Left on my own  
Cold as a stone  
No matter what you imply  
I'll survive at any sacrifice  
  
I'm walking a wasteland  
Where beauty and truth can't be seen  
A never ending game  
The world keeps on turning but I  
will stay the same



Give me an old fashioned Christmas, an old fashioned Christmas  
Family faces, wide open spaces, covered with snow  
Right now my mom there in the kitchen, basting the Christmas bird  
You'll have to take my word, you can't find that at the automat  
An old fashioned fireplace, give me an old fashioned fireplace  
My heart remembers smoldering embers, warming your glow  
I'd trade that whole Manhattan skyline, the shimmering steel and chrome  
For one old fashioned Christmas back home



I gotta take a little time  
A little time to think things over  
I better read between the lines  
In case I need it when I'm older  
  
Now this mountain I must climb  
Feels like a world upon my shoulders  
I through the clouds I see love shine  
It keeps me warm as life grows colder  
  
In my life there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far  
To change this lonely life  
  
I wanna know what love is  
I want you to show me  
I wanna feel what love is  
I know you can show me  
  
I'm gonna take a little time  
A little time to look around me  
Ive got nowhere left to hide  
It looks like love has finally found me  
  
In my life there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
I cant stop now, I've traveled so far  
To change this lonely life  
  
I wanna know what love is  
I want you to show me  
I wanna feel what love is  
I know you can show me  
  
I wanna know what love is  
I want you to show me  
And I wanna feel, I want to feel what love is  
And I know, I know you can show me  
  
Lets talk about love  
I wanna know what love is, the love that you feel inside  
I want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love  
I wanna feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide  
I know you can show me, yeah  
  
I wanna know what love is, lets talk about love  
I want you to show me, I wanna feel it too  
I wanna feel what love is, I want to feel it too  
And I know and I know, I know you can show me  
Show me love is real, yeah  
I wanna know what love is



God Send Death  
On your back look on to me  
You'll see genocide  
Face from death more than insane  
Profane pleading cries  
Watch you die inside watch you die  
  
God send death end misery  
Preach no love of ministry  
Pray for sin a shattered faith  
Down on your knees  
Your screaming out to die  
  
Death is over due  
Nothing can save you  
A morbid symphony  
Hearing you lie there screaming  
Taking life from you  
Is all I wanna do  
Desire so deranged  
This is what lives inside me  
  
Putrid blood flows through my veins  
To thrive on demise  
Voyeurs' lust watching the pain  
Touching you inside  
Bleed you fucking dry  
Bleed on me  
  
Death's design blood splattered wall  
Face melting one vicious whore  
Twisted figures flesh from bone  
Down on your knees  
Your screaming out  
To die  
  
Death is overdue  
Nothing can save you  
A morbid symphony  
Hearing you lie there screaming  
Taking life from you  
Is all I wanna do  
Desire so deranged  
This is what lives inside me  
  
Clawing at the eyes of god  
You taste your death in hand  
Your fingers bleed in vain  
Your scream-in your grave  
Clawing at the eyes of god  
You pierce your throat and hands  
You've gone insane with pain  
Your blind screaming for your god  
Pathetic god  
  
Death's design blood splattered wall  
Face melting one vicious whore  
Twisted figures  
Drown your mind in pain

That follows me  
This blue eyed boy  
Who wants to be

Well I don't know  
Just what I'm here for  
I want more than words can describe  
I've been deprived  
Can you believe it  
My whole world  
Well it's falling apart  
Well it falls  
Still it falls  
Well it falls apart around me

And I don't wish to know my ending  
I just say  
I wanna know when I begun  
I wanna know when I begun  
I wanna know where it started from  
Where it all started from  
Cause I feel like I am spinning  
I feel like I'm spinning  
I feel just like I'm spinning  
I'm spinning around  
Said I feel like I am spinning  
All around the summer  
And the winter comes and another storm  
And it falls  
Well it falls  
Still it falls apart around me  
  
And you pick me back up  
Oh, said you pick me back up  
Oh, you're gonna pick me back up

That you cry  
All the tears that you cry  
Breathing every breath that you sign



Well you can ride the hennenpin crawler for a dollar  
Peddle it around the world

'Cause when you ride the Hennepin Crawler for a dollar  
You get to touch that pie in the sky  
  
He'll show his crusty old pickle for a nickel  
Must say I'd rather not  
He tried to show a girl off of Florence street  
He's damn lucky he didn't get caught  
Fell asleep on night with a lit cigarette  
As he tried to drink away his pain  
When a fireman doused his burnt out shack  
All they found was a greasy stain  
  
Go go  
Go go  
Go go  
Go go  
Go  
  
Now you can ride the Hennepin Crawler for a dollar  
And peddle your cares away  
You can ride the Hennepin Crawler for a dollar

Sweat's gonna grease them wheels

He tried to buy a lotta ore for a quarter  
Way back in the olden days  
He sold his soul for a donut hole  
He could muster the nerve to ask for a raise  
She sold sea shells and other things  
Down by the old sea shore  
When she sold her song to a beer commercial  
She looked like a filthy whore  
Ha ha  
  
Go go  
Go go  
Go go  
Go  
  
Now you can ride the Hennepin Crawler for a dollar  
Peddle it around the world

Hennepin, Hennepin Crawler  
You can ride the Hennepin Crawler for a dollar



Through these sleepless nights  
I cry for you  
And wonder who  
Is kissing you  
Oh these sleepless nights  
Will break my heart in two  
  
Somehow through the days  
I don't give in  
I hide my tears  
That wait within  
Oh but then through sleepless nights  
I cry again  
  
Why did you go?  
Why did you go?  
Don't you know?  
Don't you know?  
I need you  
  
I keep hoping you'll come back to me  
Oh let it be  
Please let it be  
Oh, my love, please end  
These sleepless nights for me  
  
Why did you go?  
Why did you go?  
Don't you know?  
Don't you know?  
I need you  
  
I keep hoping you'll come back to me  
Oh let it be  
Please let it be  
Oh, my love, please end  
These sleepless nights for me  
  
My love, please end these sleepless nights for me



Weather man says it's rainin' again  
Perfect night for stayin' in  
Lookin' at you I don't doubt that it's true  
And did I hear you say  
Baby put on a smile  
Kick your shoes off  
And stay a while  
Well since you asked me to  
I don't mind if I do  
  
That ol' clock can just tick off the wall  
I ain't worried 'bout the time at all  
Long as I'm makin' time with you  
And holdin' you tight  
Dim light  
Opry radio  
I'll whisper baby I love you so  
And since you want me to  
I don't mind if I do  
  
That ol' clock can just tick off the wall  
I ain't worried 'bout the time at all  
Long as I'm makin' time with you  
And holdin' you tight  
Dim light  
Opry radio  
I'll whisper baby I love you so  
And since you want me to  
I don't mind if I do  
  
Just as long as it's you baby  
I don't mind if I do



I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream  
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme  
Now a memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart  
  
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue  
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do  
In anger unkind words are said they make the teardrops start  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart  
  
Yeah, there was a time when I believed that you belonged to me  
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory  
  
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart



One more night, one more night  
I've been trying ooh so long to let you know  
Let you know how I feel  
And if I stumble if I fall, just help me back  
So I can make you see  
  
Please give me one more night, give me one more night  
One more night cos I can't wait forever  
Give me just one more night, oh just one more night  
Oh one more night cos I can't wait forever  
  
I've been sitting here so long  
Wasting time, just staring at the phone  
And I was wondering should I call you  
Then I thought maybe you're not alone  
  
Please give me one more night, give me just one more night  
Oh one more night, cos I can't wait forever  
Please give me one more night, ooh just one more night  
Oh one more night, cos I can't wait forever  
Give me one more night, give me just one more night  
Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever  
  
Like a river to the sea  
I will always be with you  
And if you sail away  
I will follow you  
  
Give me one more night, give me just one more night  
Oh one more night, cos I can't wait forever  
I know there'll never be a time you'll ever feel the same  
And I know it's only words  
But if you change your mind you know that I'll be here  
And maybe we both can learn  
  
Give me just one more night, give me just one more night  
Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever  
Give me just one more night, give me just one more night  
Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever



I'd give you my ring, I'd fill you with promises  
I'd give you anything you want  
If you told me that we could be more than friends  
Run with me baby, on a magic carpet ride  
Well live for tomorrow, everything I'll be alright  
Cause it don't matter what they say  
  
She's Bobby's girl, Johnny, you're playing with dynamite.  
She's Bobby's girl, close the door baby, it'll be alright  
Come on, lets go  
  
When they say she's Bobby's girl, Johnny, you're playing with dynamite  
She's Bobby's girl, close the door honey, it'll be alright now  
  
She's Bobby's girl, come on baby, come with me tonight  
She's Bobby's girl, close the door baby, it'll be alright now

Though I spend my days in conversation, please  
Remember me  
Martha, my love  
Don't forget me  
Martha, my dear  
  
Hold your head up, you silly girl  
Look what you've done  
When you find yourself in the thick of it  
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you  
Silly girl  
  
Take a good look around you  
Take a good look you're bound to see  
That you and me were meant to be  
With each other  
Silly girl  
  
Hold you're hand out, you silly girl  
See what you've done  
When you find yourself in the thick of it  
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you  
Silly girl

Well here we are in a special place  
What are you gonna do here?  
Now we stand in a special place  
What will you do here?  
What show of soul are we gonna get from you?  
It could be deliverance, or history  
Under these skies so blue  
Could be something true  
But if I know you you'll bang the drum  
Like monkeys do  
Here we are in a fabulous place  
What are you gonna dream here?  
We are standing in this fabulous place  
What are you gonna play here?  
I know you love the high life, you love to leap around  
You love to beat your chest and make your sound  
But not here man - this is sacred ground  
With a Power flowing through  
And if know you you'll bang the drum  
Like monkeys do  
Here we stand on a rocky shore  
Your father stood here before you  
I can see his ghost explore you  
I can feel the sea implore you  
Not to pass on by  
Not to walk on by  
And not to try  
Just to let it come  
Don't bang the drum  
Just let it come  
Don't bang the drum  
Just let it come  
Don't bang the drum  
Do you know how to let it come now?  
Don't bang the drum  
Just let it come now...  
Don't bang the drum...  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum



Pack up, I've had enough, that's it, I quit  
Give up, you win, I lose, you win  
You choose, you stay  
I'll go, you stay, I lose  
  
I used to be a dreamer  
But I realize that it's not my style at all  
In fact it becomes clearer that a dreamer  
Doesn't stand a chance at all  
  
Get out of here  
Get out of here  
Get out  
Do I make myself clear  
  
No way, I must go, can't stay, must run  
No chance, I can't give a second chance  
No hope, there's no hope for you now  
No romance, no more romance  
  
No how, no how could we stay together  
No need, I have no need for you now  
No fear, no fear of you no more  
  
Get out of here  
Get out of here  
Do I make myself clear  
  
Pack up, give in, go home, get out  
  
I used to be a dreamer  
But I realized that it's not my style at all  
In fact it becomes clearer that a dreamer  
Doesn't stand a chance at all  
  
And I've become bitter  
For I believe that this is better  
No matter, whatever, whenever  
We can never ever stay together  
  
Get out of here  
Go  
  
Do I make myself plain  
I don't want to ever see you again  
Get out of here  
  
Pack up, give in, get out of here  
Rev up, go away, get out of here  
Give in, go home, right away, get to  
Pack up, give in, give up, rev up  
Go away, out



What a nice party  
And I know just why I'm feeling so new  
'Cause I came along and I found you  
  
I want to make you happy tonight  
I want to make you happy tonight  
  
It's just like magic  
Dancing with you  
While we're sharing a kiss  
Oh, I've been in love  
But never, no, never like this  
  
I want to make you happy tonight  
I want to make you happy tonight, and every day I live, yeah  
I want to give you all I have to give  
Oh, I want to make you so happy, yeah, oh  
  
Yes, I've been in love  
But never, no, never like this  
I want to make you happy tonight  
I want to make you so happy, child  
Come on, I want to make you so



Give me something I can touch with my hands  
Something I can look at and understand  
If you're up there no don't look down on me  
Do something quick I can't pay the rent  
  
Do you believe in Jesus  
Is he there  
Is there a God above  
And does he really care  
  
Oh yeah  
Jesus are you there  
And do you really care  
I don't believe in nothing no more  
  
Can't find the truth  
I just need to score  
Don't give me Hare Krishna  
Keep it to yourself man  
  
Stand back  
Get back  
Do you believe in Jesus  
Is he there  
  
Is there a God above  
And does he really care  
Oh yeah  
Jesus are you there  
  
And do you really care  
Take me on a cruise around the world  
Give me a break  
Bring me a girl  
  
Getting crazy about World War Three  
It's suicide of the sanctuary  
Should I believe in Jesus  
Is he there  
  
Is there a God above  
And does he really care  
Oh yeah  
Jesus are you there  
  
And do you really care  
Oh yeah  
No no no no  
Jesus are you there  
  
Oh yeah  
No no no no no no  
Do you really care  
Jesus are you there  
  
Anybody in  
Jesus Jesus Jesus are you there



Warning sign, warning sign,  
I see it but I pay it no mind.  
Hear my voice, hear my voice,  
It's saying something and I hope you're concentrating  
I've got money now, I've got money now,  
C'mon baby, c'mon baby.  
  
Warning sign of things to come (take it over, take it over)  
Someone's talking on my telephone (when we're older, when we're older)  
Hear my voice, move my hair.  
I move it around a lot, but I don't care. (what I remember)  
  
Warning sign, warning sign,  
Look at my hair, I like the design.  
It's the truth, it's the truth.  
Your glassy eyes and your open mouth  
Take it easy, take it easy,  
It's a natural thing and you have to relax,  
I've got money now, I've got money now.  
C'mon baby, c'mon baby.  
Warning sign, of things to come (turn me over, turn me over)  
Love is here but I guess it's gone now (hurry up babe, hurry up babe),  
Hear my voice, move my hair.  
I move it around a lot, but I don't care.  
  
Do you remember  
What it is that you remember  
Baby remember  
Baby remember.



Day by day my life gets colder  
My ice grows thin, as I get older  
Peace in peaces, bloody and bruised  
I feel so helpless and confused  
  
'Cause I hear screamin' on the left  
Yellin' on the right  
I'm sitting in the middle tryin' to live my life  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I cant stop the war  
Shelter homeless, feed the poor  
I can't walk on water  
I can't save your sons and daughters  
I can't change the world and make things fair  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do is care  
  
I pray and pray for life's salvation  
Faith is tried and true in tribulation  
Love is lost and lonely, check the news  
And with these open arms I'll wait for you  
  
'Cause I hear screamin' on the left  
And yelling on the right  
I'm sitting in the middle trying to live my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For the life of me, I can't see how the devil keeps enticing me  
All you sees a felon, I know god can see whats right in me  
How I can be labeled as a villain in the first place  
When the worst case scenario is my birth place  
I'm just tryin to keep from fallin' victim to the murder rate  
Take my life lesson convincing the adolescents  
There's a god up in heaven, sending down blessings  
And your future ain't brighter than your present  
Quit stressin'  
  
They're screamin' on the left  
Yellin' on the right  
While I'm sittin' in the middle trying to live my life  
  
'Cause I cant stop the war  
Shelter homeless, feed the poor  
Can't walk on water I can't save your sons and daughters  
I can't change the world to make things fair  
The least that I can do is care  
  
Yeah I cant stop the war  
Shelter homeless feed the poor  
I cant walk on water  
I can't save your sons and daughters  
I can't change the world and make things fair  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do  
The least that I can do  
Oh is care!



I miss the warm embrace I felt  
First time you touched me  
Secure and safe in open arms  
I should have known you'd crush me  
A snake you were when me met  
I loved you anyway  
Pulling out your poisoned fangs  
The venom never goes away  
Serpent swims free in my blood  
Dragons sleeping in my veins  
Jackyl speaking with tongue  
Roach egg laying in my brain  
Once stalked beneath your shadow  
Sleepwalking to the gallows  
I'm the sun that beats your brow in  
'Til I finally threw the towel in  
Never knowing if I'd wake up in a whirlpool got redundant  
My brain was just some driftwood in a cesspool, I became dead  
From a rock star to a desk fool was my destiny, someone said  
Love's a tidepool, taste the waters, life's abundant  
Taste me  



[Chorus]  
I'm a man on fire  
It's a burning thing  
It'll burn on forever  
If you feed me baby  
I'm a man on fire  
An eternal flame  
It'll burn on forever  
If you feed me baby, oh  
  
Gotta be a place to go in the midnight hour  
Heart of a woman and just a little bit of pulling power  
The feeling's got me  
I don't know what it means  
I know it must be wrong  
But when you love somebody you dream, and I dream  
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come  
And you're there, and you're gone  
And I'm alive for you  
And my love keeps hanging on  
  
There is no life  
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love  
There is no unifying, if I don't hear you crying  
I'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world  
Together we are strong in love  
And when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can be  
And me, I'm a man on fire  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ready when the lightning strikes and he deed is done  
I'm not a beginner  
But I'm a sinner when the heat is on  
Nothing gonna stop me, got me all that you need  
Woman, when you need somebody  
A woman with a face and a body, you dream, and I dream  
  
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come  
And you're there and you're gone  
And I'm alive for you  
And my love keeps hanging on  
  
There is no life  
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love  
There is no unifying, if I don't hear you crying  
I'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world  
Together we are strong enough  
And when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can me  
And me, I'm a man on fire  
  
[Chorus]



You sound truly heartbroken  
You can do it. you're a pro  
Agony from every pore. and such control  
The orchestra swoops and the drum samples roll  
You hold the high scream into the key change for the outro  
It's another number one  
And that's exactly where you're comin' from  
But can you play me a song  
For the deliberate loser  
Like an olympic ice skater you've put in the hours  
Learned the routines and the high scoring loops  
And even before you sing the sweet opening line  
You're know that you're scorin at least 5.9  
Here come the flowers  
I saw them gathered all around you  
Hangin' on your every word  
You were telling them you're masterplan  
World domination  
... any way you can  
  
Don't you ever wonder if this will to win is a weakness?  
Don't you ever wonder...



Words and music by Leah Kunkel  
Oh, last night I sat by your side  
Oh, I was feelin' so lonely  
Would have given up my pride  
All night I was so lonely  
Then you took to the streets  
You don't have much to say  
But I listened to your feet  
As they walked away  
Bye bye bye bye  
Now walking's the only thing I know  
Oh we do well together  
I ain't thinkin' 'bout where we go  
Lace up your boots of leather  
Then we take to the streets  
We don't have much to say  
But I listen to our feet  
As we walk away  
Bye bye bye...  
I wasn't lookin' for love  
I'm a little sorry you're gore  
But until we have something to say  
L'll just keep walking along  
Bye bye bye...  
Ask me if I need you now  
Oh no I'm feeling great  
If you hunt me in my dreams  
Ah there is one escape  
I'll just take to the streets  
I won't have much to say  
But I'll be listening to my feet  
As they walk away  
Bye bye bye...  
  



Now the corporations stopped!  
Stopped pushing fast food  
Been a multiple shooting  
Downtown at the bank  
Reluctantly the panic begins  
To catch fire  
But it did not affect  
The steady sale of jun  
The state office looked  
It looked like Hollywood  
With make-up bleeding all over the cracks  
Wo he blew his lines  
Facing the cameras  
He suffered the first  
  
[Chorus:]  
All live heart attack  
Oh you've caught an even atom tan  
  
The motor-cyanide  
Cyanide suicide  
He finally found the brick wall in his life  
Shining up his engine  
He dressed right up for it  
At the top of the speedo  
He crumpled the bike  
There's plenty people runnin' runnin' for cover-  
Hoping at best to hold off all the rest  
Once last stand at the bunker fire  
Machine gun and pitchfork and breast  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
But it isn't so easy  
So easy for lovers  
Chained in love  
Stained at the top of the tower  
The pink hearse is leaving at funeral speed  
Driving your heart  
Away with the flowers  
All night I waited  
I waited for a horseman  
His ever faithful  
His Indian friend  
I'm not the only one  
Of the caped crusader fan club watching the sky  
For mankind's friend  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh you've caught an even atom tan  
Calamine



I was ridin' number nine  
Headin' south from Caroline  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
Got in trouble, had to roam  
Left my gal and left my home  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
Just a kid actin' smart  
I went and broke my darlin's heart  
I guess I was too young to know  
They took me off the Georgia Main  
Locked me to a ball and chain  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
All alone I bear the shame  
I'm a number not a name  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
All I do is sit and cry  
When the evenin' train goes by  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
I'll be locked here in this cell  
Till my body's just a shell  
And my hair turns whiter than snow  
I'll never see that gal of mine  
Lord, I'm in Georgia doin' time  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  



She's from a world  
Of popcorn and candy  
Pony rides for a dime  
Little children laughing  
  
I'm from a world  
Of disappointments and confusions  
But I want her to be mine  
I started talking  
She kept on walking  
She disappeared into the crowd  
  
I lost my heart  
On the carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who left my heart in pieces  
Lost my heart  
On The carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who ran away.  
  
I was the clown  
And she was the dancer  
We both knew it wouldn't work  
But we took our chances  
What I can't recall  
Is if there was a girl at all  
Or was it my imagination?  
I still remember  
All of those faces  
And now all I have is memories.  
  
I lost my heart  
On the carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who left my heart in pieces  
Lost my heart  
On The carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who ran away.  
  
Two different people  
In love for an instant  
To see that the circus came today  
Sometimes I can hear her crying here  
And I can hear her calling me.  
  
Don't you know?  
I lost my heart  
On the carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who left my heart in pieces  
Lost my heart  
On The carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who ran away



Let's wake up in the afternoon  
Pretend that we got nothing to do  
No we don't have to go by any agenda  
We can make up our own rules  
I see the way you're looking at me  
Baby know I'm feeling it too  
We can just light up every candle  
Move from room to room  
  
Stopping every minute just because you're in it  
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me  
It's how it's supposed to be  
Hanging on every touch  
Baby don't rush, no no  
Baby don't rush  
  
Throw the map out of the window  
Taking the long way around  
To a secret place where no one could find us  
A little place we can call our own  
Come over here and take a picture  
Something we can hang on to  
We can look back and try to remember  
All the crazy things we gonna do  
  
Stopping every minute just because you're in it  
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me  
It's how it's supposed to be  
Just hanging on every touch  
Baby don't rush  
Baby don't rush  
  
Stopping every minute just because you're in it  
Stopping every minute just because you're in it  
Stopping every minute  
  
Stopping every minute just because you're in it  
Wishing every day was Sunday, you're right next to me  
It's how it's supposed to be  
  
Stopping every minute just because you're in it  
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me  
It's how it's supposed to be (supposed to be)  
Just hanging on every touch  
Baby don't rush no no

[Verse 1]  
I have been broken I have been bruised,  
I've had my battles and I've been accused,  
But still I will trust You, Still I will go.  
Withholding nothing from you God  
So here I stand with my heart open wide with my hands lifted up I say.  
  
[Chorus]  
I surrender all to You,  
I surrender my soul to You,  
I surrender over to Your will.  
I surrender my mind to You,  
I surrender my heart to You.  
I surrender completely to Your will.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Here I am giving my all  
I need You Lord to break through my walls.  
I give You my life, I give You my all.  
I'm ready for You to revive my soul  
So here I stand with my heart open wide withy my hands lifted up I say.  
  
[Chorus]  
I surrender all to You,  
I surrender my soul to You,  
I surrender over to Your will.  
I surrender my mind to You,  
I surrender my heart to You.  
I surrender completely to Your will.  
  
[Bridge]  
Take my pride, take my fear, take my life  
I surrender to Your will, to Your way, to Your plan I surrender. (X8)  
  
[Outro]  
I surrender (X4)  
  
[Ending]

[Chorus]  
Version Girl, what's your name?  
Oh you come and you go,  
Version Girl, what's your name?  
Just like the morning sun.  
It's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me.  
  
Version girl, what's your name?  
Don't you know I long to say.  
Version Girl, what's your name?  
It's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me  
  
I sit in the sun waiting for you to come along  
So my heart will be satisfied  
So please let me be your number one  
Under the moon, under the stars and under the sun.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Version girl, what's you name?  
Oh you come  
  
I sit in the sun waiting for you to come along  
So my heart will be satisfied  
So please let me be your number one  
Under the moon, under the stars and under the sun.  
  
[Chorus]



[Verse 1]  
I like 'em brown, yellow, Peurto Rican or Asian  
Who have the weekend occasion  
Sneak in the Days Inn  
I'm never tweaking of haze an frequently blazing  
Now if they ain't on ya face it ain't the cheeks that I stay in  
Can't deny it, used to take weeks and persuasion  
Now I just be looking down at these freaks in amazement  
With a girl, The first thing I peep a notice  
Is how full her lips is and deep her throat is  
So you ain't gotta be perfect  
I'll buy you whatever you want, But your heads gotta be worth it  
Still what I mean is  
Your brains gotta send chills through my penis  
Till I feel like a genius  
Look at it from a player's position  
I got a scholarship, I get smart without paying tuition  
My classes be like two three hours  
That's why I'm the smartest young guy since Doogie Howser  
  
[Chorus]  
Still what I mean is  
I really just want to get smart until I feel like a genius  
And all that I ask is  
That you help me get good grades in all of my classes  
Still what I mean is  
I really just want to get smart until I feel like a genius  
And all that I ask is  
That you help me get good grades, Ma in all of my classes  
  
[Verse 2]  
These bitches they done got real bad  
Cause now I pull out, Leaving 'em looking like model for a got milk ad  
I'm a teachers pet  
And even if you good at math ma  
You'll have trouble counting each baguette  
All it takes would hood tutors and some good Buddha  
And promise to buy them some of them Razor foot scooters  
They don't care where the cops is  
Outta the blue they stop biz  
Teacher started giving me a pop quiz  
I stay 10 minutes in night clubs  
Pocket full of green, Duke on it invented the night bulb  
I might pass on a female, And call up a substitute just for night  
Class in the CL  
Ya man don't know why his chicks knees be scared  
Can't tell her from giving my dick CPR  
If ya lift up and say ya jaws hurting, before squrting  
It's for certain  
You are the weakest link, Goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
You know my girls in North and South Caddy  
They all for mouth waxing  
And the whores in Texas, Oral sexes  
I head to Cali, Take more blows to the head than Ali  
And the Philly mommy's suck the kid outta Willie Bonnie  
And the way females so Southern Hospitality in ATL  
Don't even know them hoes  
In South Beach, they let me jimmy dip in they mouthpiece  
Forget about Vegas, The head is outrageous  
The broads in Seattle will make ya knees rattle  
Fa shizzle da snizzle get smizzle down in VA  
Them hoes in Detroit will suck the whole revolt  
My dick don't get to die down when I'm in Chi-Town  
My bitches in be-More, Blow til they knees sore  
Good damn, there face I, ain't screwed down in St. Lou  
New York, It ain't got no pipe instructions  
They just suck outta you like liposuction  
  
[Chorus]



(Tom Springfield)  
  
The Springfields  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
It's all over  
  
I walk around imagining  
The way you'll say goodbye  
And when you try to tell me  
I just hope that I won't cry  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
It's all over  
  
The glow has gone forever  
And our dreams have turned to dust  
I don't know how I can go on  
And yet I know I must  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
It's all over  
  
It breaks my heart to feel this way  
Although I try to smile  
To think I'll be alone again  
In just a little while  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
It's all over  
It's all over  
It's all over



I'm in my field  
I'm in my stream  
And I'm love  
I'm in my tree  
  
I take a walk  
Nine hundred miles  
I cross the stile  
I'm in my field  
  
And I'm in love  
And it's for free  
I'm in my field  
I'm in my field  
  
I'm in my field  
I'm in my stream  
And I will yield  
I'm in my field  
  
And I'm in love  
Across the stile  
Come in my field  
Just you and me  
  
We'll take a walk  
Nine hundred miles  
And I'm in love  
We'll count the stars  
  
I'm in my field  
I'm in my stream  
Well I'm in love  
Just you and me  
  
I'm in my field  
I'm in my stream  
Well I'm in love  
I'm in my tree  
  
I take a walk  
Nine hundred miles  
I cross the stile  
I'm in my field



Walking out on me must be the way you show me how it feels to be her  
I realize the fault is mine, I'm getting everything that I deserve  
It's over and older the tears seem much colder  
Sunshiney days seem to be so blue  
It's over and older the tears seem much colder  
Each passing day I wish I still had you  
My troubles would be all over now if I could only get you off my mind  
And I would give a fortune now if I could only hold you one more time  
It's over and older the tears seem much colder  
Sunshiney days seem to be so blue  
It's over and older the tears seem much colder  
Each passing day I wish I still had you  
  



Life you make it what it is  
Love can change it with a kiss  
Love can take you by the hand  
Love can drop you where you stand  
  
But still you want to have it all  
You like to live it up  
But still you want to have it all  
I thought you had enough  
But still you want to have it all  
I thought you had enough  
  
Life you make it what it is  
Love can change it with a kiss  
She can turn your head around  
He can lift you off the ground  
  
But still you want to have it all  
You like to live it up  
But still you want to have it all  
I thought you had enough  
But still you want to have it all  
I thought you had enough  
  
Love you make it what it is  
Life can change it with a kiss  
Love, love, love, love  



Let me down to rest of the world  
I'm feeling cold, cold to the bones  
Let me down so I can fly, fly, fly  
Dragonfly doesn't matter  
With flowers in the sunshine  
Warming me up to the bones, lifting me up  
So I can fly  
She's says it's nothing to be said, nothing to be gained  
From the winds that blow today  
Now you have is time, walking down the slide and twisted  
Preservatives of life  
You have what you have what you have is for you  
And the future of your child  
Look there's a full moon, I'm looking at you  
Choices, you've been wrong and you've been cold  
Choices, you've been wrong, you've been cold  
Choices, you've been wrong and you've been cold  
Choices, choices  
I'm not scared, no no  
I maybe just a little scared to die  
Scared to die  
She's said this nothing to be said, nothing to be gained  
From the winds that blow today  
Now you have is time, walking down the slide and crooked  
Preservatives of life  
You have what you have what you have is for you  
For the future for your child  
Look there's a full moon, I'm looking at you  
Choices, you've been wrong, you've been cold  
Choices, you've been wrong, you've been cold  
Choices, you've been wrong and you've been cold  
Choices, choices  



Here to the blaze  
I wander  
Through this black night  
I pounder  
The edge of our mighty swords  
Did clash  
Fallen by our axes  
Helmets smash  
Glory and fame  
Blood is our name  
Souls full of thunder  
Hearts of steel  
Killers of men  
Of warriors friend  
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers  
To the end  
One day too  
I may fall  
I will enter Odin's Hall  
I will die sword in hand  
My name and my deeds will  
Scorch the land  
Glory and fame  
Blood is our name  
Soul full of thunder  
Hearts of steel  
Killers of men  
Of warriors friend  
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers  
Sons of the gods today we shall die  
Open Valhalla's door  
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind  
Hail Gods of War  
[Solo]  
Sons of Odin we for  
By the hammer of Thor  
Ride down from the sky  
Another is born  
Another shall fall  
This day bent will die  
(oh) Glory and fame  
(oh) Blood is our name  
(oh) Souls full of thunder

(oh) Hail  
(oh) Gods  
(oh) of War!!!  
[Onward into the heart of the battle  
Fought the sons of Odin  
Outnumbered many times  
Still - they fought on  
Blood poured forth from their wounds  
Deep into the earth  
Vultures waited for the broken shells  
That once were bodies  
Thus Odin alone would choose the day  
They would enter Valhalla  
And in their hour of need  
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage  
Now gods embed  
They grows up from the ground  
Screaming like wild animals  
Such is the gift of absolute power  
No blade or weapon would hurt them  
They killed them and horses alike  
And all who stood before them died that day  
Hail Gods Of War]  



Jessie she stares like a cat with a bird  
That has fallen and broke its wing  
Terri she puts on her make-up  
And wonders what promise the new day will bring  
  
Debbie stays home with the baby  
While I work my hands to the bone  
Yeah I make a living they do the giving  
In a house we've been calling home  
  
Just a house we've been trying to live in  
Just a place we've been calling our own  
Me and my wives have been spending our lives  
In a house we've been calling home  
  
Jessie's the youngest she always needs  
Answers to questions that I just don't know  
Terri she can't sit still for a moment  
She's always in some hurry to go  
  
Debbie's been with me the longest  
We spend most of our time on the phone  
Talking in rhymes with no reasons in mind  
For this house we've been calling home  
  
Just a house we've been trying to live in  
Just a place we've been calling our own  
Me and my wives have been spending our lives  
In a house we've been calling home



Things worked out better than we had planned  
Capital from boy, woman and man  
We were like ink and paper  
Numbers on a calculator  
Knew arithmetic so well  
Working overtime completed what was assigned  
We had to multiply ourselves  
A bouncing little baby  
A shiny copper penny  
And he spent himself  
Would not listen to us  
But when he lost his appetite  
He lost his weight in friends  
Baby became a fat nickel so fast  
Then came puberty  
Exponentially  
Soon our boy became a million  
People loved him so  
And helped him to grow  
Everyone knew the thing that was best  
Of course, he must invest  
A penny won't do  
But he made us proud  
He made us rich  
But how were we to know  
He's counterfeit  
Now everything's ruined

You've changed  
That sparkle in your eyes has gone  
Your smile is just a careless yawn  
You're breaking my heart, you've changed  
  
You've changed  
Your kisses are now so blase  
You're bored with me in every way  
I can't understand you've changed  
  
You've forgotten the word I love you  
Each memory that we've shared  
You ignore every star above you  
I can't realize you ever cared  
  
You've changed  
You're not the angel I once knew  
No need to tell me that we're through  
It's all over now, you've changed  
  
You've forgotten the word I love you  
Each memory that we've shared  
You ignore every star above you  
I can't realize you ever cared  
  
You've changed  
You're not the angle I once knew  
No need to tell me that we're through  
It's all over now, you've changed  
I miss you



His smile like a million roses bathed in rock 'n' roll  
Ours was the greatest love story ever told  
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold  
That's my baby  
  
He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall  
A heart that would beat like a base for his baby doll  
One in a million, inimitable song  
That's my baby  
Young or old, summer or cold  
Young or old, summer or cold  
You've got a way like jfk  
When you pull it the way that you move it  
Spins me around like a record, baby  
And you've got a soul like no one I know  
You're so erratic the way you see through that shit  
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy  
He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall  
A heart like a base that would beat for his baby doll  
Mind like a diamond, an inimitable song  
That's my baby  
Young or old, summer or cold  
Young or old, summer or cold  
You've got a way like jfk  
When you pull it the way that you move it  
Spins me around like a record, baby  
And you've got a soul like no one I know  
You're so neurotic the way you see through that shit  
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy  
It drives me crazy  
You've got it and I want it  
Wild summer nights in July, funny  
You know that you can always come home to the one who gave you your name  
'Cause I see a light in your eyes  
It's so bright and the skies, they open wide for you  
So come to me, my baby  
You've got a way like jfk  
When you pull it the way that you move it  
Spins me around like a record, baby  
And you've got a soul like no one I know  
You're so erratic the way you see through play that shit  
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy  
It drives me crazy  
It drives me crazy  
Crazy



"I just want to set the world afire"  
Red flash clouds choking out the morning sky  
They said it'd never come, we knew it was a lie  
All forms of life die now, the humans all succumb  
Time to kiss your ass goodbye, the end has just begun  
Distorted figures walk the street, it's 1999  
Weeds once underneath the feet have grown to vines  
Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face  
No time to change your fate, no time left, it's too late  
The arsenal of Megadeth can't be rid of they said  
And if it comes the living will envy the dead  
Racing for power and all come in last  
No winning, first stone cast  
This falsehood worldly peace  
Its treaties soon will cease  
No one will be left to prove that humans existed  
Maybe soon the children will be born open fisted  
We all live on one planet and it will all go up in smoke  
Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy  
And now the final scene, a global darkening  
Dig deep the piles of rubble and ruin  
Towering overhead both far and wide  
There's unknown tools for World War III  
Einstein said, 'We'll use rocks on the other side'  
No survivors, set the world afire!



Step inside the dream machine  
You're on a power drive  
Feel the passion of the beast  
Watch her come alive.  
  
Oh-- you're almost there, ride on silver air  
You better hold on tight-- she's fire in the night.  
  
Chorus:  
Faster than the speed of light  
Hugging all the curves  
Hang on to your life  
Faster than the speed of light  
Supercharged and flying low  
She's liquid dynamite.  
  
Got your hands upon the wheel  
The pedal to the floor  
Now it's time for nerves of steel  
Hear the engine roar.  
  
Oh-- you shoot the thrill-- heading for the kill  
No control tonight-- she's liquid dynamite.  
  
Repeat Chorus twice



Here we are on earth together,  
It's you and I,  
God has made us fall in love, it's true,  
I've really found someone like you  
  
Will it say the love you feel for me, will it say,  
That you will be by my side  
To see me through,  
Until my life is through  
  
Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world,  
In love you and I, you and I, you and I  
  
I am glad at least in my life I found someone  
That may not be here forever to see me through,  
But I found strength in you,  
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day,  
Because that's all that I am living for, you see,  
Don't worry what happens to me  
  
Cause' in my mind, you will stay here always,  
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I  
In my mind we can conquer the world  
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I



There was a place in East St. Louis, it was in  
Nineteen fifty nine, when they played they filled  
The streets with music, that lonely blue note music  
That takes your cares away, far away  
They packed the place when the band was playin'  
To get some joy from a smoke filled room, through that door  
You could see the bodies swayin', the blue note band  
Was playin' some lonely blue note song all night long  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
No place I'd rather stay  
If you should ever make it to St. Louis on some hot  
And lonely night, if you listen you can hear  
That blue note music, they fill the streets with music  
It carries you away, far away  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
No place I'd rather stay

Melinda was mine  
'Til the time  
That I found her  
Holding Jim  
Loving him  
  
Then Sue came along  
Loved me strong  
That's what I thought  
Me and Sue  
But that died too  
  
Don't know that I will  
But until I can find me  
A girl who'll stay  
And won't play games behind me  
I'll be what I am  
A solitary man  
Solitary man  
  
I've had it to here  
Bein' where  
Love's a small world  
Part-time thing  
Paper ring  
  
I know it's been done  
Having' one  
Girl who'll love me  
Right or wrong  
Weak or strong  
  
Don't know that I will  
But until I can find me  
The girl who'll stay  
And won't play games behind me  
I'll be what I am  
A solitary man  
Solitary man  



Seven thousand miles to Paris  
Nine hundred miles to Rome  
And I'm goin' every mile to find  
My piece of mind at home  
This infatuatio is driving me insane  
To make my reservation  
On the next L.A. plane  
Make me high, make me sane  
Get me aboard that L.A. plane  
I'm tired of the pouring rain  
Get me safe, get me warm  
Get me a Southern California morning  
Where I was born, boy I'm coming  
I'm coming home to you  
He look so fine in Europe  
On all the posters and the brochures  
I thought they promised something more  
Than what was mine and yours  
Well I was looking for excitement  
On every boat and train  
But all I saw were unfamiliar faces in the rain  
Get me high, get me sane  
Get me aboard that L.A. plane  
I'm tired of this pouring rain  
I'm tired of just passing through  
Get me safe, get me warm  
Get me a Southern California morning  
Where I was born, babe I'm coming  
I'm coming home to you  
And now nothing look better in my mind  
Than your warm and loving face  
And all these miles have taught me  
That your loved can't be replaced  
Get me high, get me sane  
Get me aboard that L.A. plane  
I'm tired of this pouring rain  
I'm tired of just passing through  
Get me safe, get me warm  
Get me a Southern California morning  
Where I was born, babe I'm coming  
I'm coming home to you



Imagination is funny  
It makes a cloudy day sunny  
Makes a bee think of honey  
Just as I think of you  
Imagination is lazy  
Your whole perspective gates hazy  
Has you askin a daisy what to do  
What to do  
  
Have you ever felt a gentle touch  
And then a kiss  
And then, and then  
Find it's not only your imagination  
Again  
Oh, well  
Imagination is silly  
I go around all willy nilly  
For example I go around wanting you  
And yet I can't imagine that  
You'd want me too  
And yet I can't imagine that  
You'd want  
Me  
Too



[Jesse to God]  
  
A storm is come  
One war of sun and rain - within me  
A raging storm  
Lost crossroads thundering - in the wind  
Dark and son  
Who's the only one  
To lay claim of me  
Altars of store  
Righteous temptations  
Here at my feet  
  
Give me love  
To rage in me can you see?  
Only love  
Is saving me  
Give me love, oh love  
That rage in me  
  
It rages on  
Of mourn and memories  
In the wind  
A warring storm  
My soul is bargaining - in the end  
Is there no sun?  
With only love in vain - and it's pain  
Hear me oh Lord  
Cleanse me evermore with  
Your blood of rain  
  
Holy war for my soul  
Scares of memories remain  
Oh, tell me why am I here  
Storms of crossroads are rage



A to be  
Different degrees  
  
So much style without substance  
So much stuff without style  
It's hard to recognize the real thing  
It comes along once in a while  
  
Like a rare and precious metal  
Beneath a ton of rock  
It takes some time and trouble  
To separate from the stock  
You sometimes have to listen to  
A lot of useless talk  
  
Shapes and forms  
Against the norms  
Against the run of the mill  
Swimming against the stream  
Life in two dimensions  
Is a mass production scheme  
  
So much poison in power  
The principles get left out  
So much mind on the matter  
The spirit gets forgotten about  
Like a righteous inspiration  
Overlooked in haste  
Like a teardrop in the Ocean  
A diamond in the waste  
Some world-views are spacious  
And some are merely spaced  
  
Against the run of the mill  
Static as it seems  
We break the surface tension  
With our wild kinetic dreams  
Curves and lines  
Of grand designs



[Intro]  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Let's funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown  
  
[Verse 1]  
I lay around, touch myself to pass the time  
I fell down, I wish you were mine  
I close my eyes  
Take a breath and I picture us in a place  
I can't recognize  
[Pre-Chorus]  
In the fire I call your name out  
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh)  
Up full night tryin' to rub the pain out  
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh)  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm singin'  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Let's funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown  
  
[Verse 2]  
I fool myself  
Swirl around as if I'm someone else  
Your hands are mine  
I do a trick  
Pretend that I am you until it clicks  
I come alive  
Come alive  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
In the fire I call your name out  
(call your name out, call your name out)  
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh) (call your name out)  
Up full night tryin' to rub the pain out  
(oh-o-oh-oo-ahh-ahh) (rub the pain out)  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm singin'  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Let's funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Let's funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown  
  
[Bridge]  
Hurts inside, but not this time  
All the things that are on my mind  
Vanish as I touch myself  
Call out loud for you  
Oh, can you hear me singin'?  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
I'm singin'  
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Let's funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Let's funk downtown  
Tap down those boots while I beat around  
Funk me downtown



(Robert Telson)  
  
A desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
Some place better than where you've been  
A coffee machine that needs some fixing  
In a little cafe just around the bend  
I am calling you  
(Don't you hear me)  
I am calling you  
A hot dry wind blows right through me  
The baby's crying and I can't sleep  
But we both know a change is coming  
Coming closer, a sweet release  
I am calling you  
(I know you hear me?)  
I am calling you  
I'm gonna walk through the desert to find you  
Gone leave behind the only life I know  
There's a place for hearts that need fixing  
A little cafe with a magic show  
I am calling you  
(Can't you hear me?)  
I am calling you  
Desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
That coffee machine still needs fixing



Honey, just allow me one more chance  
To get along with you.  
Honey, just allow me one more chance,  
Ah'll do anything with you.  
Well, I'm a-walkin' down the road  
With my head in my hand,  
I'm lookin' for a woman  
Needs a worried man.  
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,  
'Low me just-a one more chance.  
  
Honey, just allow me one more chance  
To ride your aeroplane.  
Honey, just allow me one more chance  
To ride your passenger train.  
Well, I've been lookin' all over  
For a gal like you,  
I can't find nobody  
So you'll have to do.  
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,  
'Low me just-a one more chance.  
  
Honey, just allow me one more chance  
To get along with you.  
Honey, just allow me one more chance,  
Ah'll do anything with you.  
Well, lookin' for a woman  
That ain't got no man,  
Is just lookin' for a needle  
That is lost in the sand.  
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,  
'Low me just-a one more chance.



I was born a travelin' man, that's all Ill ever be  
Moving around from town to town is what makes me so free  
My father was a trucker for the years of 23  
On the day that I was born his blood was left to me  
  
I'm a travelin' man  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
Travelin' man  
Travelin' man  
That's what I am  
  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
No woman puts a hold on me  
You'll see me once or maybe twice  
That's all you'll see of me  
All you pretty women lord, I hope you understand  
Don't be a fool lord no, and put your heart in a travelin' man  
  
I'm a travelin' man  
Travelin' man  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
Travelin' man  
  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
Guess Ill always be  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
But at least I'm free  
  
Travelin' man  
Oh, that's what I am  
  
Travelin' man, that's what I am, lord I move so fast  
I have had so many women, none of them have last  
I am just a mover, moving fast as sound  
Always free, sometimes lonely. always movin around  
Travelin' man  
Travelin' man, that's what I am  
Travelin' man  
Oh, that's what I am



It's a heartache  
And the happiness  
That won't let you rest  
It's a pleasure  
  
And the pain that comes  
When you love someone  
You spend so much time  
Trying to get it right  
  
Don't ask the reason why  
It's a part of life  
  
[Chorus]  
Our love can be difficult at times  
But it was by design  
Our love was difficult at times  
But it was by design  
  
It's a laughter  
Beyond the tears  
That you need to hear  
But you know that  
You can make it through  
When a love is true  
It feels like a lonely road  
You don't know which way to go  
How I want you to know  
You are not alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love is difficult  
But it's by design  
Love is difficult  
But it's by design  
  
Love is difficult  
But it's by design  
Love is difficult  
But it's by design  
  
[Repeat Chorus]



Baby this life can break your heart  
Everyone hurts to some degree  
But while this world is fallin' apart  
Why don't you come be with me?  
Don't you know that night can be so cold  
When you're without the one you need?  
How much longer do I have to go  
Waiting for you? Come be with me  
Love can be so simple  
When you let it flow  
Get it in your head, feel it with your heart  
Send it from your soul  
Look up at the stars burnin' bright  
Listen to the wind whisper sweet  
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right  
Why don't you come be with me?  
(Ooh ooh ooh)  
Love can be so simple  
When you let it flow  
Get it in your head, feel it with your heart  
Send it from your soul  
Look up at the stars burnin' bright  
Listen to the wind whisper sweet  
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right  
(Know the moment's right)  
Why don't you come be with me?  
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right  
(Why?)  
Why don't you come be with me?  



Everyone gather near  
And I'll tell you a story that you'll love  
Ooh it's christmas time

Ooh, hoo  
I can't eat right  
I can't sleep nights  
Oh, honey look at what you've done to me  
Life is nowhere  
And it's no fair  
'Cause you've got me by the memory  
  
Oh, now I feel you near me  
And see your face  
In my dreams  
Every hour all night through  
Oh, I'm haunted  
Yes I'm haunted, haunted by you  
  
There ain't no doubt  
I can't get out  
Of this trouble that you've got me in  
If I hurt you  
Didn't mean to  
Oh, and I'm sorry  
Ain't the word I've been  
And if you don't come back to me pretty soon  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
  
'Cause I'm haunted  
Yes I'm haunted, haunted by you, woah, oh

'Cause you haunt me everywhere I go  
Oh I'm begging you

You don't have to touch it to know  
Love is everywhere you go

Love is every second we steal  
Love is love is nothing without you  
Love is love is everything you do  
Open up your eyes  
And you will see  
Love is love is everything to me  
You don't have to touch it to be  
Wrapped up in emotion like me  
Everyone must feel how I do, yeah

And everything you say  
Must bring her closer, closer to you

Have you ever lived  
only so you can die again, then be born again  
from these enemies, on the borderline  
Who'll be the next to fire

We want equal rights and justice.. for

You do the combat math, I'm the war artist  
You can't take your shots back, I have to watch them miss  
The basketball rim shook like a tambourine  
Not an unlikely event in a game that means nothing  
In a game that means nothing  
  
Makeshift we are, lead never leaves your system no matter who you are  
Makeshift we are, as makeshift as we are  
  
You're a complex dune, I'm a cloud of octopus ink  
You're an elusive tune, I'm more ice sculpture than I think  
You're the neutral tribe and I got the wrong openness  
Here's where I slowly close my eyes and say, "I'm too drunk for this"  
Yeah, I'm too drunk for this  
  
Makeshift we are, 'Weaklings Make Trouble' you played on your guitar  
Makeshift we are, as makeshift as we are, we are, we are, we are  
  
The loneliest boys on dolphin property  
You're as quiet as a fish, I only sing for the whole sea  
From memory metal tension springs, we were gunsmoke and the truth  
Let's shake some snow off of his shoulders  
Let's shake some snow off of the roof, let's shake some snow off of the roof  
  
Makeshift we are, occurring to each other under the setups of the stars  
Makeshift we are, we imagine us here and here we are  
Makeshift we are, through half-squinted eyes becoming a mirage  
Makeshift we are, we are, we are



Imagine sailing solo around the world  
Only to find you've missed a continent out  
And as your happy turns choppy and tidal wave swirls  
You're wondering why there's no one about  
  
At least Captain Scott actually stood on the spot  
Where he planned to put up Union Jack  
And though Captain Cook cursed the map that he took  
He got near enough for native's attack  
  
That's how it feels trying to navigate you  
Even with compass and infinite time  
And just when I think I've found some part that's new  
I find a flag already up that's not mine  
  
Circling you is journey minus view  
Exploration without reason or reward  
'Cause when I get near, you use an arrow or spear  
To prevent my heart ever being shored  
  
The earth ain't flat but it's a simple doormat  
Compared to your unclimbable self  
The desolate terrain, you have to cross to your brain  
Just one of your slippery shelves  
  
That's how it feels trying to navigate you  
Even with compass and infinite time  
And just when I think I've found some part that's new  
I find a flag already up that's not mine  
  
And if I ever get close, I'll need a banner or post  
To hang it from, first there or not  
So voyage may uncover a sister or brother  
And a friendship that Colombus forgot



Well, the light's turnin' gray, nearly every day  
Come a walkin' into town and try to find the way  
Well, I've only got a nickel, got to score myself a dime  
And try to make it 'til tomorrow, buy a little more time  
  
Evil woman  
Evil woman  
Evil woman  
  
Well, my damsel she's a woman with coal black hair  
Don't you look her in her eye when she starts to stare  
'Cause her beauty drive you crazy  
And her potions steal your soul  
No matter how you beg her she don't ever let you go  
  
Well, you can cry, you can plead, it won't help you none  
She'll keep you in the shadows, never see the sun  
Try to run, try to hide find a place to stay  
No matter where you go you can't get away  
  
Evil woman  
Evil woman  
Evil woman, oh  
  
For evil woman set my life free  
I can't go on livin' this way, no  
Evil woman set my life free  
Pullin' me down, down I can't go on this way  
Down, down my head will go against the floor again  
Down, down I can't go on this way  
Down, down my head will go against the floor again  
  
Down, down I can't go on this way  
Down, down my head will go again  
Down, down I can't go on this way  
Down, down my head will go again  
  
Down, down I can't go on this way  
Down, down my head will go again  
Down, down I can't go on this way  
Down, down, down  
  
Well, the light's turnin' gray nearly every day  
Come a walkin' into town try to find my way  
I said I only got a nickel got to score myself a dime  
Try to make it 'til tomorrow buy a little more time  
  
My damsel, she's a woman with coal black hair  
Don't you look her in her eye when she starts to stare  
'Cause her beauty drive you crazy  
And her potions steal your soul  
No matter how you beg her she don't ever let you go  
  
Evil woman  
Evil woman  
Evil woman



I remember so well  
The day that you came  
Into my life  
You asked for my name  
You have the most beautiful smile  
  
My life started to change  
I wake up each day feeling all right  
With you right by my side  
Makes me feel things  
Will work out just fine  
  
How did you know  
I needed someone like you in my life  
That there was an empty space in my heart  
You came at the right time in my life  
I never forget how you brought the sun to shine in my life  
And took all the worries and fears that I had  
I guess what I'm really trying to say  
It's not everyday that someone like you comes my way  
No words can express how much I love you  
  
How did you know  
I needed someone like you in my life  
That there was an empty space in my heart  
You came at the right time in my life  
I never forget how you brought the sun to shine in my life  
And took all the worries and fears that I had  
I guess what I'm really trying to say  
It's not everyday that someone like you comes my way  
No words can express how much I love you



Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high  
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby  
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue  
And the dreams that you dare to dream, really do come true  
  
Someday, I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
Away above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh, why can't I?  
If happy little blue birds fly beyond the rainbow  
Why, oh, why can't I?



Oh my baby, hold me, there is only you and me  
Oh, I cannot wait forever - no I cannot wait forever  
Tell me there's a heaven and there is a destiny  
Oh, I cannot wait forever - so I cannot wait forever  
I will tell you baby, oh my love is real  
Can't you feel it lady - feeling what I feel?  
  
I will follow you - oh, every time and every minute  
I will follow you - see my love is true  
I will follow you - every time and every minute  
All I want to do - is making love to you.....  
  
There's no me without you, why an angel breaks my heart  
Oh, I cannot wait forever - no I cannot wait forever  
Please send me a rainbow, and we'll try a brand new start  
Oh, I cannot wait forever - so I cannot wait forever  
And beyond my tears girl - I will see your smile  
Baby I can't wait - or wait a while  
  
I will follow you.....



Yes I hid your car keys, honey  
Yes I hid your suitcase  
And I'm the reason you can't find  
Your makeup and your toothpaste  
And I'll do anything it takes  
To keep you here with me  
Losing you's a sure way  
To set off my allergies  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm allergic to the blues  
I get these teardrops in my eyes  
You know I've always had a bad reaction to goodbyes  
So 'till they find some injection  
To calm that love rejection  
All I've got to save me now is you  
I'm allergic to the blues  
  
It won't be five minutes  
After you walk out that front door  
'Till I'll be fightin' for my breath and  
Feelin' like I'm done for  
Well they might find me froze to death  
In our bed alone  
Now do you really want that  
On your conscience while your gone  
  
[Chorus:]



Listen to me...  
I've got a warning for you  
You've got to learn to take more care  
'Cause if you swim in dirty water  
  
Be careful how you dry your hair  
In a room within a room  
In a hole within a hole  
You've got to learn to share your secrets  
Or you'll lose your soul  
  
I've got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town, another one night stand  
You know, you broke the law...  
  
It's so hard to hold back  
When the fire is in your eyes  
A silver dollar in my pocket  
I don't like surprises  
  
I've got your souvenir  
Is that the price I've got to pay?  
It ain't been that long  
Since the last charade  
  
I've got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town, another one night stand  
You know, you broke the law...  
  
I know you're guilty  
But I'm carrying the blame  
I took out much more than I put in  
And I felt the pain  
In a dirty little room  
With nowhere left to hide  
You told the truth with your eyes  
But you lied inside  
  
I've got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town, another one night stand  
You know, you broke the law...



Words and music by Robb (Rabbitt) MacKay  
Now there's a new craze a-goin' 'round  
It's gettin' bigger in most every town  
From New York City out to Hollywood  
Got everybody in the neighborhood  
CHORUS:  
Down in the unemployment line  
You got yourself a place and I got mine  
We been here waitin' since the clock struck nine  
Down in the unemployment line  
Now every day you've got to fight the horde  
Just to read what's on the bulletin board  
When you go back and try and claim your space  
Some other sucker come and stole your place  
CHORUS  
I hope the people in the government  
Tell us how we're gonna pay the rent  
How we're gonna get enough to eat  
No that the workin' man is obsolete  
If things keep goin' like they seem they do  
Won't be long before they're down here too  
And they can be a part of this here mob  
Workin' nine to five to find a job  
CHORUS  
  



She went away for the holidays said she's  
Going to L.A. but she never got there  
She never got there, she never got there, they say  
  
She went away for the holidays said she's  
Going to L.A. but she never got there  
She never got there, she never got there, they say

The KKK took my baby away The KKK took my baby away  
They took my girl they took my baby away



This one goes out to that special someone in my life  
Oh, we all have somebody special  
This is for you  
  
I like ice cream, cherry pie  
And lemonade with summer breeze  
I like rainbows, leafy trails  
And puppy dogs with bumble bees  
  
I like cotton candy gum  
And bumper cars and carnivals  
Golden skies and hazel eyes  
And sand in-between my toes  
  
But, something tells me that I hate you  
Something tells me I must kill you  
  
You ain't shit but a slutty ass mother fucking slut you fuckin whore.  
I fuckin' hate you  
  
I like birthday candle cakes  
And titty shakes with silicone  
Secret whispers and ? sister  
And apple dips, gingerbread homes  
  
Faygo chills, they give me thrills  
And NyQuil pills they make me sleep  
Hershey kisses and heppy misses is something so bliss, but yet all the while  
  
Somethin' tells me that I hate you,  
Somethin' tells me I must kill you  
  
Suck my fuckin' dick, fuck off,  
go fuck yourself you fuckin' ass little bitch.  
  
Come on come on bitch, come on come on come on come on bitch I fuckin' hate
you  
Come on come on bitch come on come on  
  
I like shaggy, he's my friend  
I like his mom 'cause she's nice to me  
Thank you J I like you too  
Well it's OK, we're family  
  
Raver chicks and kung fu flicks  
And sugar sticks like lolly pop  
All these things happiness brings  
But my hatred for you don't stop, bitch  
  
Something tells me that I hate you  
Something tells me I must kill you  
Something tells me that I hate you  
Something tells me I must kill you  
  
Bitch I fuckin' hate you I'll fuckin kill you  
  
You selfish bitch



Electric guitar is run over, by a car on the highway  
  
This is a crime against the state  
This is the meaning of life  
  
Tune this electric guitar  
Tune this electric guitar  
Tu-tune this electric guitar  
Tune this electric guitar  
  
Electric guitar is plugged-in  
Recording, "Fa" (from "Psycho Killer")  
  
Judge and the jury  
Twelve members of the jury  
All listening to records  
Is this is a crime against the state?  
Ah, this is the verdict they reach:  
  
Never listen to electric guitar  
Never listen to electric guitar  
Never listen to electric guitar  
Never listen to electric guitar  
  
Electric guitar is copied  
Copy sounds better  
Call this law of justice  
Call this freedom and liberty  
I thought I perjure myself  
Right in front of the jury  
  
Is this a crime against the state?  
No, this is the verdict they reach:  
  
Someone controls electric guitar  
Someone controls electric guitar  
Someone controls electric guitar  
Someone controls electric guitar



She's ahead of her time and she's never lazy  
But something changed your mind and she could drive you crazy  
Volunteers for winter coats and summer clothes that shine  
Volunteers for magazines I read them all the time  
But that's all right  
Do do do do do do do do do do - do do do do do do da da da  
Down the runway  
Do do do do do do do do do do - do do do do do do do  
She's so ugly  
  
Tidy work never suffers when you stage your abuse  
Cocktails in the evening when you're completely nude  
Models at the motor show and I dribble at the thought  
Models looking like lobsters, convertibles and sports



Wish you told me by and by,  
That my life would come to this,  
That I'd have to find a way  
to let things go,  
That my friends would turn to foes,  
And my love would come to blows,  
Then I would have done some things  
differently.  
  
Differently...  
I would ask you out every night.  
Differently...  
And I would make you feel so good.  
Differently...  
And appreciate the things that  
you bring to me, babe.  
Differently...  
Oh yes I would, oh yeah.  
  
Yeah, I know you tried and tried,  
But your signal I just missed,  
When you said my little girl  
would soon be gone,  
Yes I didn't hear you then,  
And it might be too late now,  
That's another thing I'd do  
differently.  
  
Differently...  
Like trying to make you feel  
loved every day.  
Differently...  
And saying little things to  
let you know how I feel.  
Differently...  
Yes I can hear your young  
voice calling me, babe.  
Differently...  
Oh yes I can.  
  
When I 'm away I call you up,  
And you don't seem to miss me as much,  
But I know our love  
is still there in your heart,  
Just differently.  
  
Differently...  
Oh yes, I can hear your young  
voice calling me, babe.  
Differently...  
Oh yes I can.  
Differently...  
I'd appreciate the things that you  
bring to me babe, yes I would.  
Differently...  
Oh come on back to me babe,  
bring your love back to me.  
Differently...  
Oh yeah I need your love,  
I need your love.  
Differently...  
Yes I can tell you babe,  
I need your love.  
Differently...  
Today is a brand new day, yes it is.  
Differently...  
Got to get your love back, babe,  
come on now bring it back to me.  
Differently...  
Turn it around babe, turn it  
around and bring it back.  
Differently...  
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, got to get  
your love back, come on babe.  
Differently...  
Yeah I can hear your young  
voice calling me babe.  
Differently...  
Come on back to me, come on back,  
yeah yeah, turn it around.  
Differently...  
Oh yes I can, yes I can.  
Differently.



Are you falling asleep at the wheel  
Maybe there's a feeling, you've been brushing off  
Asking reason, what's left for me here  
Well he's all out of answers  
You're not out of luck  
I've got this something  
That's been going round  
I've got this something  
You don't know it  
But you need it  
I've got this something  
That's been going round  
I've got this something  
You don't know it  
But you need it now  
Are you hungry?  
Won't you come get your fill  
We could put this thing in motion  
If you'd stop acting tough  
Superstar you sit up high on your hill  
I know why you're running  
Only you know what you've lost  
I've got this something  
That's been going round  
I've got this something  
You don't know it  
But you need it  
I've got this something  
That's been going round  
I've got this something  
You don't know it  
But you need it now  
When the sun goes down  
It's here waiting  
It is still right here for you now  
And when the sun comes out  
It's still waiting  
It is still right here for you now  
Doo doo doo doo doo,  
Doo doo doo doo doo,  
Doo doo doo doo  
I've got this something  
That's been going round  
I've got this something  
You don't know it  
But you need it  
I've got this something  
I've got this something, yeah  
I've got this something  
You don't know it  
But you need it  
Yeah yeah, you don't know it  
Yeah, you don't know it  
But you need it  
I've got this something  
I've got this something, yeah  
You need this something now  



I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail  
Yes I would  
If I could, I surely would  
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail.  
Yes I would  
If I only could, I surely would.  
  
Away, I'd rather sail away  
Like a swan that's here and gone  
A man gets tied up to the ground  
He gives the world  
Its saddest sound, its saddest sound  
  
I'd rather be a forest than a street.  
Yes I would  
If I could, I surely would.  
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet  
Yes I would  
If I only could, I surely would



Now I want to wrestle in the garden  
I'm on my way to stardom  
I know I'm ready, I know I'm great  
But first I've got to get in shape!  
  
Cause I got my eye on the Russian Bear  
Gonna tear him up, I swear  
This guy, thinks he's the champion  
Gonna take his belt, gonna beat him!  
  
I'm the Crusher, king of the ring (4x)  
I'm ready for a match with the Russian Bear  
Gonna pile drive him, pull his hair  
I might have a foreign object in my trunks  
I might have to use, on that punk!  
  
Got the hardest hold you can put on anyone  
If you're my victim you're beaten  
I'm a lean, mean, fighting machine  
Powerful and strong, like King Kong!  
  
I'm the Crusher, king of the ring (4x)  
Started having second thoughts I was scared as hell  
The last thing I wanted was me hearing the bell  
I mean the Russian Bear, could probably tear  
Me limb from limb  
He'd probably grin be real happy with himself  
This is not, good for my health  
I'm not comin' outta this dressing room  
And get beaten up, by that goon!  
  
Go back to Russia  
Go back home  
Don't want to get a broken bone  
Or a lump on my head  
I ain't gonna hide under the bed!  
  
I'm the Crusher, king of the ring [Repeat x4]  
I'm the Crusher (Crusher!) [Repeat x2]



When love comes so late, it'll really hit hard  
It slams through the gate, it'll catch you off guard  
Everyone said, "What a perfect love match  
'Cause she is so smart, she's a hell of a catch"  
  
I was drinking in love, gulping it down  
Drifting for months on a billowing cloud  
But after awhile I stopped to rebel  
I'm back in the past and I'm raising up hell  
  
But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life  
And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life  
  
We'd been living together for over a year  
The harmony's perfect, it rang loud and clear  
But then very slowly, my nerves start to fray  
The little things big, that's what they say  
  
I acted impatient, I acted unkind  
I took her for granted, I played with her mind  
She didn't deserve it but it was too late  
I walked out the door and left her to her fate  
  
But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life  
And I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life  
  
(Whoo Whoo Whoo...)  
Now I'm down in a slump and I'm eating alone  
I ruined the day with some friends on the phone  
I never go out, I'm becoming a grouch  
I just watch the TV and I drink on the couch  
  
But if love comes again, I'll be really surprised  
I'll grab it real fast, keep it right in my sights  
  
'Cause I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life  
Well I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life



Every now and then you like to take it easy  
Sit right back and view the situation  
The future is brighter  
Soon we'll be riding on the crest of a wave  
  
[Chorus]  
Good-bye to all your troubles  
Change of heart, the world will start today  
It's like a new beginning  
See it shining like a brand new star  
  
Well, if you're thinking that you'll end up crying  
Maybe all you need is to get away from friends  
And the walls around you  
Find a shore, step into the sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Brand new star  
  
I won't be a burden upon your shoulder  
I will give you wings so you can fly  
To lands where you're dreams surround you  
Find a shore and step into the sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Brand new star  
Like a brand new star



I haven't' listened to a word you've said  
I've been wandering inside my head  
Don't care what you think of me  
You only see what you want to see  
So here I am in my paradise  
In my heaven everything is alright  
Only the young stay young I said  
Speaks the kid inside my head  
Only the young stay young inside  
Only the young - only the young  
Only the young - only the young  
I've been around for a long time  
Losing my way but not my mind  
So I drink and play you along  
But who cares when the fire burns on  
So I'm out here in my paradise  
It's my heaven and it feels so right  
Only the young stay young I said  
Speaks the kid inside my head  
Only the young stay young inside  
Only the young stay young I said  
Speaks the kid inside my head  
Only the young stay young at heart  
Only the young - only the young  
Only the young - only the young  
Live your life - in this time  
We've only today - drink life's wine  
Don't be fooled  
Don't believe what they say  
Don't believe what they say  
I haven't' listened to a word you've said  
Say what you like  
You're not in my head  
Time goes with each breath we take  
It rules the world the day we awake  
So here I sit here in my paradise  
Don't give a damn everything is alright  



Christmas' future is far away  
Christmas' past is passed  
Christmas' present is here today  
Bringing joy that will last  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your hearts be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yule time gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yoke  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow  
(Hang a shining star)  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now  
(Have yourself a merry little Christmas now...)



(On memory's bliss of you)  
  
The candle plays the hourglass  
The days go and all I do is  
Think of you and wonder where you are at night  
Oh I remember everything  
Every smile, and even all  
The reasons why you say  
I pushed you out of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby you set me  
Baby you set me  
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you  
Baby you set me  
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you  
  
Destiny is everything  
Reality's replaced you with  
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life (ever had in life) ohh  
Bet you say that I don't care  
I bet you say that I don't even think of you  
But God knows how wrong you are  
  
Baby will you be there when the morning comes?  
(Baby will you be there?)  
Just give me time (just give me time)  
To fix my life (to fix my life, baby)  
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes?  
After all the time I've spent, wishing you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sadness that overwhelmed me  
My mind flies and carelessly  
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now oh  
I guess that's just the was it goes  
Forever's gone so now I must  
Place you with all the things that I can never have  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So come on now  
I know this much is true  
I know this much is true



Lovely Rita meter maid,  
Nothing can come between us,  
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.  
  
Standing by a parking meter,  
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,  
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.  
In a cap she looked much older,  
And the bag across her shoulder  
Made her look a little like a military man.  
  
Lovely Rita meter maid,  
May I inquire discreetly,  
When are you free to take some tea with me.  
Took her out and tried to win her,  
Had a laugh and over dinner,  
Told her I would really like to see her again  
  
Got the bill and Rita paid it,  
Took her home I nearly made it,  
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.  
  
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid,  
Where would I be without you,  
Give us a wink and make me think of you



As we stroll along together  
Holding hands and walking all alone  
So in love are we two  
That we don't know what to do  
  
So in love  
So in love  
  
As we walk along together  
'neath the stars twinkling high above  
  
So in love are we two  
That we don't know what to do  
  
So in love  
So in love  
  
I tell, I tell you my darling  
I need you, I need you oh so much  
I love, I love you my darling  
Can't you tell it from my touch  
  
As we walk down the isle together  
As we vow to stay together till we die  
  
So in love are we two  
Just can't wait to say I do  
  
So in love  
So in love  
Oh you and I  
So in love



Money isn't everything, ask anyone who's rich  
It can buy pain and misery or grief  
Though money isn't everything  
I have a pauper's itch, so though I crave a brave  
Yes, I'll take the chief!  
  
He bought me a cat, Siamese, imagine that  
He keeps making, fancy passes at me  
All those fine and fancy passes  
  
Oh joy, now I've got sixty feet of brand new yacht  
He keeps making fancy passes at me  
All those fine and fancy passes  
  
He owns New York or Spain but I don't know which  
He got fat in Uptown Manhattan  
Poor Cinderella's got her a fella who's rich  
Every penny, he's worth a plenty  
  
He owns United Airlines, that as well?  
He owns receding hairlines, oh, well  
He's not so hip or smart as a whip  
But healthy, wise and wealthy  
  
He bought me a summer place  
Somewhere out in outer space  
He keeps making fancy passes at me  
  
What a man you've got, Diane  
Did he buy you a mink? Passion pink  
And a Cadi too? Baby blue  
You're speaking of? My baby love  
Your Romeo? My Daddy Dough  
I love him a lot, how much has he got?  
  
He's got a plot of ground, he found over oil  
Oh, my how chic we are  
He bought New Jersey  
So he could call me his girl  
Oh, man, a feat we are  
  
Chocolate excites my tummy  
He bought me a firm called Yummy  
So, he's one of those gents  
With good bizness cents  
And quarters, half's and dollars  
  
Ding, dong, ain't it swell  
They just delivered the liberty bell  
How sad all those Philadelphians will be  
  
I'll get half of what he owns  
To keep up with Mrs. L. B. Jones  
And if he keeps making fancy passes  
I'll start holding evening classes  
  
I'll give him sugar and molasses  
And the life, I live, I'll live luxuriously  
From those late and evening classes  
That sugar and molasses  
Those fine and fancy passes at me  
My honey, yeah



Do you remember  
When we fell in love  
We were so young and innocent then  
Do you remember  
How it all began  
It just seemed like heaven so why did it end?  
  
Do you remember  
Back in the fall  
We'd be together all day long  
Do you remember  
Us holding hands  
In each other's eyes we'd stare  
(Tell me)  
  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
When we first met girl  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
  
Do you remember  
How we used to talk  
(Ya know)  
We'd stay on the phone at night till dawn  
Do you remember  
All the things we said like  
I love you so I'll never let you go  
  
Do you remember  
Back in the Spring  
Every morning birds would sing  
Do you remember  
Those special times  
They'll just go on and on  
In the back of my mind  
  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
When we first met girl  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
  
Those sweet memories  
Will always be dear to me  
And girl no matter what was said  
I will never forget what we had  
Now baby!  
  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
When we first met  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
When we first met  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
  
Remember the times  
Ooh  
Remember the times  
Do you remember girl  
Remember the times  
On the phone you and me  
Remember the times  
Till dawn, two or three  
What about us girl  
  
Remember the times  
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you  
Remember the times  
In the park, on the beach  
Remember the times  
You and me in Spain  
Remember the times  
What about, what about  
  
Remember the times  
Ooh, in the park  
Remember the times  
After dark  
Do you, do you, do you  
Remember the times  
Do you, do you, do you, do you  
Remember the times  
Yeah yeah



All I do is dream of you  
The whole night through  
With the dawn I still go on  
Dreamin' of you  
  
You're every thought, you're everything  
You're every song I ever sing  
Summer, winter, autumn and spring  
  
And were there more than twenty-four hours a day  
They'd be spent in sweet content just dreamin' away  
  
When sky's are gray, when sky's are blue  
Morning, noon and nighttime, too  
All I do the whole day through is dream of you  
  
When sky's are grey,  
Even when they're blue  
  
And were there more than twenty-four hours in a day  
Oh they'd be spent in sweet content just dreamin' away  
  
When sky's are gray, when sky's are blue  
Morning, noon and nighttime, too  
All I do the whole day through is dream  
(I'm dreamin', dreamin' a dream)  
Of (Just dreamin', I dream a little dream)  
You



Oh, oh, oh  
  
I never thought that it'd be easy  
'Cause we both so distant now  
And the walls are closing in on us  
And we're wondering how  
No one has a solid answer  
Just walking in the dark  
And you can see the look on my face  
It just tears me apart  
  
So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)  
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry  
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)  
And we try, and try, and try, and try  
  
[Chorus]  
So it's up to you and it's up to me  
That we meet in the middle  
On our way back down to earth  
Down to earth, down to earth  
On our way back down to earth  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
  
Mommy you were always somewhere  
And Daddy I live outta town  
So tell me how could I ever be normal some how  
You tell me this is for the best  
So tell me why am I in tears, woah  
So far away and now I just need you here  
  
So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)  
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry  
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)  
And we try, and try, and try, and try  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We fell so far away from where we used to be  
Now we're standing, and where do we go  
When there's no road, to get to your heart  
Let's start over again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never thought that it'd be easy  
'Cause we both so distant now  
And the walls are closing in on us  
And we're wondering how.



I'm the most dangerous person in this room  
The way you look  
I could do some damage to myself  
It's your heart against mine  
And I fear I may capsize  
I'm operating without a license  
But I'm willing to pay the price  
'Cause you're just so easy  
You're so damned easy on the eyes  
  
You turn your face  
The two sides don't synchronize  
You're nothing like anyone I've ever seen before  
If I'm staring at you then I apologize  
You defy every rule I've learned  
But still I've never been half so turned on  
And you're just so easy  
You're so damned easy on the eyes  
  
Handsome's not a word that comes to mind  
But I'd have to be blind to try and minimize  
How easy you are on the eyes  
Easy on the eyes  
In my vertigo  
You're easy on the eyes  
From head to toe  
You're so easy on the eyes  
  
I'm operating without a license  
But I'm willing to pay the price  
And you're just so easy  
You're just so damn easy on the eyes



We've been through days of thunder  
Some people say we don't belong  
They try to pull us under  
But here we stand together in the new year strong  
  
Let's get on with the show  
(Let's get started)  
Turn the lights down low  
(Turn the lights down low)  
You were there from the start  
(You were there)  
We know who you are  
And this one goes out to  
  
[Chorus]  
Everyone (yeah) , everyone, everyone  
This one goes out to you,  
Everyone  
We're standing stronger 'cause' of what you've done  
This one goes out to you  
  
We've been inside the circus  
We take the pleasure with the pain  
I guess there's something about us  
Whatever comes around will always stay the same  
Oh yeah  
  
Let's get on with the show  
(Oh let's get started)  
Turn the lights down low  
(Turn the lights down low)  
You were there from the start  
(You were there)  
We know who you are  
(we know who you are)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now we're minutes away  
Till it's time to play  
Our heartbeats are rising  
They're letting you in  
Time for the show to begin  
  
Here  
We're standing stronger from what you've done  
This one goes out to you, you, you  
You make us feel like we've just begun  
And this one goes out to you... yeah  
  
[Chorus: x2]



Same ol' bedroom floor  
Same ol' empty sheets  
I hate this haunted bed  
So down here's where I sleep  
  
Tryin' to find a place  
To hide what you have left  
Some things never change  
My heart hasn't yet  
  
Well I don't wanna go out tonight  
Yeah but I can't be alone  
Standing underneath this broke streetlight  
Can't somebody take me home  
Can't somebody take me home  
  
The hope that we had left  
Wrapped around your ring  
That river just rolled on by  
When I watched it sink  
  
Well I don't wanna go out tonight  
Yeah but I can't be alone  
Standing underneath this broke streetlight  
Can't somebody take me home  
Can't somebody take me...  
  
Out of this bar  
Out of this heartache  
Out of this town  
That just keeps breakin' down  
Keeps breakin' down...  
  
Well I don't wanna go out tonight  
Yeah but I can't be alone  
Standing underneath this broke streetlight  
Can't somebody take me home  
  
I don't wanna go out tonight  
Yeah but I can't be alone  
Standing underneath this broke streetlight  
Can't somebody take me home  
Can't somebody take me home  
Won't you take me home



A scrap of flesh  
And a heap of bones  
One deep high  
And a desperate moan  
  
Three black eyes  
And a busted nose  
I said oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
Take me up  
Baby I'm ready to go  
Shake me up  
Baby I'm ready to go, yeah  
Take me up  
Baby I'm ready  
Baby, baby I'm ready to go  
(Chill me, freeze me, It's in my blood)  
  
I'm not going to burn in hell  
I cased the joint  
And I know it well  
Maybe my carcass  
Would feed the worms  
But I'm working  
For the other firm  
  
Take me up  
Baby I'm ready to go  
Fix me up  
Baby I'm ready to roll, yeah  
Set me up  
Baby, baby, baby I'm ready to go  
(Chill me, freeze me, It's in my blood)  
Flip the switch  
  
I got my money, my ticket  
All that shit  
I even got myself  
A little shaving kit  
What would it take  
To bury me  
I can't wait  
I can't wait to see  
  
I got toothbrush, mouthwash  
All that shit  
I'm looking down  
In the filthy pit  
I had the turkey  
And the stuffing too  
I even saved  
A little bit for you  
  
Lethal injection is a luxury  
I want to give it  
To the whole jury  
I'm just dying  
For one more squeeze  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Pick me up  
Baby I'm ready to go  
Take me up  
Baby I'm ready to blow  
Take me up  
Baby if you're ready to go  
Baby I got nowhere to go  
Baby I'm ready to go  
(Chill me, freeze me, to my bones)  
Flip the switch



Today's gonna make a wonderful yesterday  
One on which I know that I can look back and smile  
And with you here with me the hours have flown away  
And today's gonna make a wonderful yesterday  
Today we have made a thousand and one memories  
That we can recall when today is a sweet used to be  
And with you in my arms the future seems so far away  
And today's gonna make a wonderful yesterday



The crown of the kingdom is given to the woman  
The kingdom of the kitchen where she says she shouldn't,  
There on the stainless steel her cigarettes and matches  
Whistles to the radio to every hook she catches,  
  
But the frowns  
Eider downs,  
Tie her down  
But she likes to wear the crown of the kingdom.  
  
She like the recipes a touch of oriental  
Steaming up the windows burning egg on metal,  
Sees in a catalogue a shiny new appliance  
Another role swallowed by the wonders of science,  
  
Lobster hands  
Omelette pans,  
Understand  
How the crown can stick like jam in her kingdom.  
  
He's been so busy and she's been neglected,  
The problem is computed and always it's rejected,  
Out of her heart I catch a spark,  
And being smart  
The crown is left out in the dark now there's no kingdom.  
  
Fed up with the glory she abdicates her title  
Sitting at a bar stool she gives her day's recital,  
The family watch in horror  
As she staggers up the hallway  
Makes herself a sandwich  
As they're looking through the doorway,  
She goes to bed  
Leg by leg,  
Nothing's said  
There's no crown upon her head there's no kingdom.  
  
Press the button on the toaster  
It's a woman's world,  
Tuck the sheets in on the bed  
It's a woman's world,  
Take your apron from your holster  
It's a woman's world,  
Shoot the crown off of your head  
It's a woman's world.



Someone to hold you too close  
Someone to hurt you too deep  
Someone to sit in your chair  
And ruin your sleep  
And make you aware of being alive  
  
Someone to need you too much  
Someone to know you too well  
Someone to pull you up short  
And put you through hell  
And give you support for being alive-being alive  
Make me alive, make me confused  
Mock me with praise, let me be used  
Vary my days, but alone is alone, not alive!  
  
Somebody hold me too close  
Somebody force me to care  
Somebody make me come through  
Ill always be there  
As frightened as you of being alive,  
Being alive, being alive!  
  
Someone you have to let in  
Someone whose feelings you spare  
Someone who, like it or not  
Will want you to share a little, a lot of being alive  
Make me alive, make me confused  
Mock me with praise, let me be used  
Vary my days, but alone is alone, not alive!  
  
Somebody crowd me with love  
Somebody force me to care  
Somebody make me come through  
Ill always be there  
As frightened as you to help us survive,  
Being alive, being alive, being alive, being alive



We come to your mountain  
The hill of the Lord we would ascend  
And journey into your holy place  
To feast in your presence  
And bring our devotions to you, God  
We come as a kingdom of your priests  
  
To minister at your holy throne  
Where thousands of angels joyfully sing  
  
We're climbing up the mountain of the Lord  
Towards your holy place  
And every step is praise  
Encountering the glory of your name  
Your throne of holiness  
The wonders of your grace  
  
Come, come let us worship  
Come let us recognize what a sacred thing we do  
Come, let us bow down  
God, as we bring our hearts  
Let them please the heart of you  
We enter your santuary

Catch a plane to Hollywood

There's so much I don't know  
There's so much I don't know  
I don't understand why the summer's so hot  
I don't understand why an apple core rots  
And I have no idea when I'll see a rainbow  
But there's one thing I do know  
  
[Chorus]  
I know that God ain't no stained glass window  
And I believe there is a Holy Ghost  
I know that God ain't no stained glass window  
'Cause He never keeps His window closed  
  
There's so much I don't see  
There's so much I don't see  
I don't see how hair can turn silver-grey  
I don't see why my prayers can't get answered right away  
I don't see why some folks keep a load in their mind  
With a sharp axe to grind  
  
And I don't understand why the truth takes a twist  
I don't understand why there is loneliness  
I don't know why they claim some men have no soul  
But there's one thing I do know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No, He never keeps His window closed



I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime  
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time  
Cause at 5 o'clock, they take me to the Gallows Pole  
The sands of time for me are running low, yeah!  
  
When the priest comes to read me the last rites  
I take a look through the bars at the last sights  
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me  
  
Can it be that there's some sort of error  
Hard to stop the surmounting terror  
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?  
  
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming  
It's not easy to stop from screaming  
The words escape me when I try to speak  
Tears flow, but why am I crying  
After all I'm not afraid of dying  
Don't I believe that there never is an end  
  
As the guards march me out to the courtyard  
Somebody cries from a cell "God be with you"  
If there's a God then why has he let me go?  
  
As I walk my life drifts before me  
Though the end is near I'm not sorry  
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away  
  
Mark my words, believe my soul lives on  
Don't worry now that I have gone  
I've gone beyond to seek the truth  
  
When you know that your time is close at hand  
Maybe then you'll begin to understand  
Life down here is just a strange illusion.  
Yeah hallowed be thy name  
Yeah hallowed by thy name  
Yeah



There is a rose in Spanish Harlem  
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem  
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun  
It only comes out when the moon is on the run  
And all the stars are gleamin'  
  
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete  
But soft and sweet and dreamin'  
  
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem  
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem  
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul  
And starts a fire there and then I lose control  
I have to beg your pardon  
  
I'm going to pick that rose  
And watch her as she grows in my garden  
  
I'm gonna pick that rose  
And watch her as she grows in my garden  
  
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem  
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem  
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun  
It only comes out when the moon is on the run  
And all the stars are gleamin'  
  
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete  
But soft and sweet and dreamin'  
I'm going to pick that rose  
And watch her as she grows in my garden  
  
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem  
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem  
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem



So my sister and I left Louisiana  
Where the moon on the Mississippi is a-shining ever,  
Like you always hear in the songs of Dixie.  
We look forward to our home-coming?  
And the sooner the better.  
  
Anna II  
  
And the sooner the better!  
  
Anna I  
  
It's a month already since we started  
For the great big cities where you go to make money.  
In seven years our fortune will be made  
And then we can go back.  
  
Anna II  
  
In six years would be much nicer.  
  
Anna I  
  
Our mom and dad and both our brothers wait in old Louisiana  
And we'll send them all our money as we make it,  
For all the money's got to go to build a little house  
Down by the Mississippi in Louisiana.  
Right, Anna ?  
  
Anna II  
  
Yes, Anna.  
  
Anna I  
  
She's the one with the looks, I'm realistic,  
She's just a little mad, my head is on straight.  
But we're really one divided being  
Even though you see two of us  
And both of us are Anna,  
Together we've but a single past, a single future,  
One heart and one savings account,  
And we only do what's best for one another.  
Right, Anna?  
  
Anna II  
  
Yes, Anna.

Kinda woman that don't even need my help

No doubt, there's something about her (there's somethin' about her)  
  
Cause she work like a boss

Car and the crib she 'bout to pay 'em both off  
And bills are payed on time, yeah

The feelin' was clear  
Clear as a blue sky on a Sunday day  
Everything was you  
'Cause no one made me feel  
The way I felt with you  
Call on me 'cause  
I love you  
You know I do  
You love me too  
  
Then came a change  
When I said I would soon be leavin' you  
Nothin' else to do  
Please remember I never lose the thought of you  
Call on me 'cause  
I love you  
You know I do  
You love me too  
  
You've got to find  
Someone else to somehow take my place  
Share his life with you  
But if you need a friend  
You can always count on me  
Count on me 'cause  
I love you  
You know I do  
You love me too  
  
You can count on me oh  
You can count on me  
You can count on me baby  
You can count on me  
You can count on me oh  
You can count on me  
You can count on me baby

You can count on me oh  
You can count on me  
You can count on me baby  
You can count on me  
You can count on me oh  
You can count on me



I hopped off the plane at LAX  
With a dream and my cardigan  
Welcome to the land of fame excess,  
Whoa, am I gonna fit in?  
  
Jumped in the cab,  
Here I am for the first time  
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign  
This is all so crazy  
Everybody seems so famous  
  
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick  
Too much pressure and I'm nervous,  
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio  
And the Jay Z song was on  
And the Jay Z song was on  
And the Jay Z song was on  
  
[Chorus]  
So I put my hands up  
They're playing my song,  
And the butterflies fly away  
Noddin' my head like, yeah  
Movin' my hips like, yeah  
I got my hands up,  
They're playin' my song  
You know I'm gonna be okay  
Yeah, it's a party in the USA  
Yeah it's a party in the USA  
  
Get to the club in a taxi cab  
Everybody's looking at me now  
Like "who's that chick, that's rockin' kicks?  
She's gotta be from out of town"  
  
So hard with my girls not around me  
Its definitely not a Nashville party  
Cause' all I see are stilettos  
I guess I never got the memo  
  
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick  
Too much pressure and I'm nervous  
That's when the D.J. dropped my favorite tune  
And a Britney song was on  
And a Britney song was on  
And a Britney song was on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feel like hoppin' on a flight (on a flight)  
Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)  
But something stops me every time (every time)  
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright  
  
[Chorus: x2]



There's a note on the table.  
Said I ain't coming back.  
'Til your sorry ass is gone.  
I'm tired of the cheating and running around.  
I never saw the wrong in anything you've done.  
  
Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.  
There's got to be a bottle in the back.  
Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.  
Got to get this devil off my back.  
  
Well I stumble my way into my local bar.  
Where I saw the devil in my glass.  
The bartender told me it was time to go.  
I told him that he could lick my sack.  
  
Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.  
There's got to be a bottle in the back.  
Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.  
Got to get this devil off my back.  
  
Kentucky, Tennessee, you better find Whiskey.  
Not leaving that's a fact.  
Small batch sour mash.  
Red nose, red face, gonna wreck the whole place.  
Looking through the bare glass.  
Bald head chapped ass gone.  
It's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.  
Lord it's a hard thing to overcome to wake up and find the  
Whiskey's gone.  
  
Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.  
There's got to be a bottle of Jim Black.  
Whiskey's gone but I ain't leaving.  
Got to get this devil off my back.



Can you feel a little love?  
Can you feel a little love?  
  
Dream on  
Dream on  
  
As your bony fingers close around me  
Long and spindly  
Death becomes me  
Heaven, can you see what I see?  
  
Hey, you, pale and sickly child  
You're death and living reconciled  
Been walking home a crooked mile  
  
Paying debt to karma  
You party for a living  
What you take won't kill you  
But careful what you're giving  
  
There's no time for hesitating  
Pain is ready, pain is waiting  
Primed to do it's educating  
  
Unwanted, uninvited kin  
It creeps beneath your crawling skin  
It lives without, it lives within you  
  
Feel the fever coming  
You're shaking and twitching  
You can scratch all over  
But that won't stop you itching  
  
Can you feel a little love?  
Can you feel a little love?  
  
Dream on  
Dream on  
  
Blame it on your karmic curse  
Oh, shame upon the universe  
It knows its lines  
It's well rehearsed  
  
It sucked you in, it dragged you down  
To where there is no hallowed ground  
Where holiness is never found  
  
Paying debt to karma  
You party for a living  
What you take won't kill you  
But careful what you're giving  
  
Can you feel a little love?  
Can you feel a little love?  
  
Dream on  
Dream on



I lit my purest candle close to my window  
Hoping it would catch the eye  
Of any vagabond that passed it by  
And I waited in my lonely house  
  
Before he came I felt him drawing near  
And as he neared I felt the ancient fear  
That he had come to my door and jeer  
And I waited in my fleeting house  
  
Tell me stories, I called to the hobo  
Stories of old, I smiled to the hobo  
Storie of cold, I wept to the hobo  
As he stood before my fleeting house  
  
No, said the hobo, no more tales of time  
Don't ask me now to wash away the grime  
I can't come in for it's too high a climb  
And he walked away from my lonely house  
  
Then you be damned I screamed to the hobo  
Turn into stone I cried to the hobo  
Leave me alone I knelt to the hobo  
And he walked away from my fleeting house  
  
I lit my purest candle close to my window  
Hoping it would catch the eye  
Of any vagabond who passed it by  
And I waited in my fleeting house



Every year when summer comes around  
They stretch a banner 'cross the main street in town  
You can feel somethin's happenin' in the air  
Well, from Carol's house up on Telegraph Hill  
You can see the lights going up out in Soldiers Field  
Getting ready, for the county fair  
  
County fair, county fair,  
Everybody in town'll be there  
So come on, hey we're goin' down there  
(hey) Little girl with the long blond hair  
Come win your daddy one of them stuffed bears  
Baby, down at the country fair  
  
Now you'll be hangin' tight when we hit the top  
And that rollercoaster's ready to drop  
And your braggin', how you wasn't even scared  
Well baby you know I just love the sound  
Of that pipe organ on the merry-go-round  
Baby, down at the county fair  
  
County fair, county fair,  
Everybody in town'll be there  
So come on, hey we're goin' down there  
(hey) Little girl with the long blond hair  
Come win your daddy one of them stuffed bears  
Baby, down at the country fair  
  
At the north end of the field they set up a stand  
And they got a little rock and roll band  
People dancin' out in the open air  
It's James Young and the Immortal Ones  
Two guitars, (baby) bass and drums  
Just rockin', down at the county fair  
  
(well) County fair, county fair  
Everybody in town'll be there  
So come on, we're goin' down there  
Little girl with the long blond hair  
Come win your daddy one of them stuffed bears  
Baby, down at the county fair  
  
Now it's getting late before we head back to town  
We let that fortune wheel spin around  
Come on mister tell me what's waiting out there  
On my way out I steal a kiss in the dark  
Hope I can remember where our car's parked  
Baby, out at the county fair  
  
Now off down the highway there's the last stream of cars  
We sit a while in my front yard  
With the radio playin' soft and low  
I pull Carol close to my heart  
And I lean back and stare up at the stars  
Oh I wish, I'd never have to let this moment go



All I got is a Black Cross,  
And two crabs in my left eye,  
What you say you want you want,  
Like a lump in your right thigh.  
  
We're going left on right,  
And I don't want to see you again,  
Going left on right,  
And I don't wanna be your friend,  
We're going left on right,  
And I don't want to see you again,  
Going left on right,  
And I don't wanna be your friend.  
  
You the users of the wheel,  
Stink of oil and electric eels,  
Users of forbetten tools,  
We must be the fools.  
  
We're going left on right,  
And I don't want to see you again,  
Going left on right,  
And I don't wanna be your friend,  
We're going left on right,  
And I don't want to see you again,  
Going left on right,  
And I don't wanna be your friend.  
  
Cancel the world,  
Erase history,  
There is no future,  
As far as I can see,  
  
We're going left on right,  
And I don't want to see you again,  
Going left on right,  
And I don't wanna be your friend,  
We're going left on right,  
And I don't want to see you again,  
Going left on right,  
And I don't wanna be your friend.



Monday morning you sure look fine  
Friday I got travelin' on my mind  
First you love me, then you fade away  
I can't go on believin' this way  
I got nothing but love for you  
So tell me what you really want to do  
First you love me then you get on down the line  
But I don't mind, I don't mind  
  
I'll be there if you want me to  
No one else that could ever do  
Got to get some peace in my mind  
Monday morning you look so fine  
Friday I got travelin' on my mind  
First you love me, then you say it's wrong  
I can't go on believing for long  
  
But you know it's true  
You only want me when I get over you  
First you love me then you get on down the line  
But I don't mind, I don't mind  
I'll be there if you want me to  
No one else that could ever do  
Got to get some peace in my mind



Mister you've been caught at last chasing dogs in moonlight  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
And it's all gone wrong  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
And it's all been tried before  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
Have you seen the one eyed hound ?  
Tell me where he's going  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
Every place that I have been, no-one else has seen him  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
And it's all gone wrong  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
And it's all been tried before  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
Everybody's telling me exactly where to go  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
People come and people talk but they don't reach agreement  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
And it's all gone wrong  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
And it's all been tried before  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  



Me and the vivid girl  
In our hammock to the stars  
Staring into the fire before TV,  
The remote-control's on Mars  
  
In the dope of the pigment,  
In the poetic state of mind  
In a flood of country  
We lay down to kill some time  
  
And we spoke languidly  
Of the Northern Bee  
And collecting dewdrops for tea  
Underneath the cannonball tree  
  
We were high,  
We were sherpa-high,  
We conspired against old friends  
We said we must be friends or die  
And we've died a thousand times  
Since then  
  
And we spoke long, at length  
Of the fight or flee  
And of nothing in particularly  
Underneath the cannonball tree  
  
We spoke off-handedly  
Of new extremes  
And of nothing in particularly  
Underneath the cannonball tree  
  
We're at the point  
Where we love or hate it  
We can write it down  
And obliterate it  
When we're at the point  
When we neither love nor hate it  
We can lay down  
And obliterate it



Catlong sighs, holdin' Kitty's black tooth  
She left to marry some top cat, ain't it the cold truth?  
And there hasn't been a tally since Sally left the alley  
Since Sally left with Big Pretty, things have got pretty thin  
It's tight on this fence since them young dudes are musclin' in  
  
Jack Knife cries 'cause Baby's in a bundle  
She goes runnin' nightly, lightly through the jungle  
And them tin cans are explodin' out of the 90-degree heat  
Cat somehow lost his baby down on Bleecker Street  
It's sad but it sure is true  
Cat shrugs his shoulders, sits back and sighs  
  
Catlong lies back-bent on a trash can  
Flashin' lights that cut the night, dude in the white says he's the man  
Well, you better move fast when you're young, or you're not around  
Cat somehow lost his Kitty in the city pound  
So get right, get tight, get down  
Who's that down at the end of the alley? She's been gone so long  
Here she comes, here she comes  
Here she comes, here she comes  
  
Kitty's back in town, here she comes now  
Kitty's back in town  
Cat knows Kitty's been untrue and that she left him for a city dude  
Well, she's so soft, she's so blue  
When he looks into her eyes, he just sits back and sighs  
Ooh, what can I do, ooh, what can I do?  
Ooh, what can I do, ooh, what can I do? Alright  
Ooh alright, ooh alright  
Ooh alright, ooh alright



Never Been Funked  
I ain't trying to make no political statement  
I ain't trying to tell you the news of the world  
I ain't one to give intellectual realness  
I just want you to want me the way that I do  
  
Don't it make you feel good, make you feel good?  
Don't it make you feel good?  
  
[Chorus]  
You ain't never been funked like this before  
Never been funked, never been funked  
You ain't never been funked like this before  
  
I don't keep in touch with economical worries  
My interest don't lie in that same old story  
Communicating was never my problem  
I never have to talk to get through to you  
Talk,talk  
  
Do you really want to funk with me?  
Do you really want to funk with me?



Off the coast of Africa,  
Bound for South America,  
A world away from here  
Is a ship that sails the sea,  
Is a man who's just like me  
And I wish that I was there.  
  
I'm a lonely lighthouse,  
Not a ship out in the night.  
I'm watching the sea.  
She's come halfway round the world  
To see the light and to stay away from me.  
There is a shipwreck lying at my feet,  
Some weary refugee from the rolling deep.  
Ah, could you lose it all and fall for me?  
  
Couldn't we shine?  
I'm rolling all my golden moments into one.  
Like to shine like the sun  
For one more summer day.  
Like to shine like a lighthouse  
For one last summer night,  
Flashing on, flashing, fading away.  
  
Well if you feel lost and lonely  
And don't know where to go  
And you hear this song on the radio,  
Or even if you're feeling healthy  
And strong, you might like to sing along.  
But just because I might be standing here,  
That don't mean I won't be wrong this time.  
You could follow me and lose your mind.  
  
Couldn't we shine?  
Rolling all my golden moments into one.  
Like to shine like the sun  
For one more summer day.  
Like to shine like a lighthouse  
For one last summer night,  
Flashing on, flashing, fading away.  
  
Off the coast of Africa,  
Bound for South America,  
A world away from here  
Is a ship that sails the sea,  
Is a man who's just like me  
And I wish that I was there.



Your loving seemed to be the best thing  
That I ever had  
Your loving seemed to be the best thing  
That I ever had  
  
Your loving seemed to be the best thing  
That I ever had  
Your loving seemed to be the best thing  
That I ever had  
  
Silk and satin make me wonder  
Just who I am  
To be with you in times of slumber  
Makin' me a man  
  
I haven't known you for a very long time  
But it's on my mind what I want to do  
A trip to the skies we begin to fly  
Oh  
  
All the riches I have taken  
From you every night  
Pay you back someday with interest  
'Cause your loving makes it right  
Yeah  
  
Your loving seemed to be the best thing  
That I ever had  
Your loving seemed to be the best thing  
That I ever, ever had  
Oh yeah  
  
Best thing



Boy meets girl in prime of life  
Blinded by big city lights  
I'm on fire and you're the flame  
You inspire the road I take  
You take me to a better place  
You're the sun and I'm the rain  
  
You're all that I need to make me believe  
I'm over the edge but I'm not afraid  
Cause I know it's true  
  
With a girl like you (like you) to be by my side  
With a girl like you, love me for the inside  
With a girl like you I set the scene to follow  
With a girl like you, love for all tomorrow  
With a girl like  
You  
  
You were raised to be so good  
I grew up misunderstood  
We were distant worlds apart  
Feels so right it's meant to be  
Shootin' stars and chemistry  
They unite a beating heart  
  
You're pullin' me up, I can't get enough  
Comin' on strong but I'm not that tough  
But I know it's true  
  
With a girl like you (like you) to be by my side  
With a girl like you, love me for the inside  
With a girl like you I set the scene to follow  
With a girl like you, love for all tomorrow  
With a girl like  
  
You  
You  
  
With a girl like you (like you) to be by my side  
With a girl like you, love me for the inside  
With a girl like you I set the scene to follow  
With a girl like you, love for all tomorrow  
With a girl like  
You



Little Joe, run for the border  
Leave your home  
Go where the reptiles roam  
On the side of the border that is your home  
  
Little Joe, eyes of your lover look back on you  
As you run for cover  
Though stick and fire and may break your bones  
There's a light in the tunnel that leads you home  
  
Little Joe, just like your father  
Your eyes will water, your guts will splatter  
Though sticks and fire, sticks and fire  
Won't break your bones, it is a lie  
  
Little Joe, run for the border  
Leave your mother and father  
Go to where the reptiles roam  
They're waiting for you, Little Joe



Everyday we earn our meager pay  
But it takes its toll to play the happy prole.  
The buy your labor, try to steal your soul -  
Bite the bullet, hold your tongue and play the happy prole.  
Paranoid and tired - quit before you're fired.  
But they've got you in the hole, so you play happy prole.  
You need the money so you got to play it dumb,  
but if you play it long enough it's just what you become.  
Pay your rent, pay your bills, pay the doctor for your pills  
So you can work another day, as life slips away.



Captured effortlessly  
That's the way it was  
Happened so naturally  
I did not know it was love  
The next thing I felt was  
You holding me close  
What was I gonna do?  
I let myself go  
  
And now we're flyin' through the star  
I hope this night will last forever  
  
I've been waitin' for you  
It's been so long  
I knew just what I would do  
When I heard your song  
Filled my heart with your bliss  
Gave me freedom  
You knew I could not resist  
I needed someone  
  
And now we're flyin' through the stars  
I hope this night will last forever  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better  
Makes me happy  
Makes me feel this way  
Ain't nobody  
Loves me better than you  
  
I wait for night time to come  
And bring you to me  
Can't believe I'm the one  
I was so lonely  
I feel like no one could feel  
I must be dreamin'  
I want this dream to be real  
I need this feelin'  
  
I make my wish upon a star  
And hope this night will last forever  
OH oh oh oh  
[Chorus]  
  
And first you put your arms around me  
Then you put your charms around me  
I can't resist this sweet surrender  
Oh, the nights so warm and tender  
We stare into each other's eyes  
And what we see is no surprise  
Got a feeling most would treasure  
And a love so deep we cannot measure  
  
[Chorus]x2



Doctor where's your remedy?  
I've got enough to pay the fee  
Can't you see I'm awful sick?  
I'll pay you well to do the trick  
  
Doctor where's your magic box  
There's no one here to count the cost  
Name your price and make the sale  
There's no-one here to tell the tale  
  
Doctor please don't lock your door  
I've never troubled you before  
Just a pinch to ease the pain  
I'll never trouble you again



Gone with the wind  
Just like a leaf that has blown away  
Gone with the wind  
My romance has flown away  
  
Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips  
I've had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips  
  
But now all is gone  
Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart  
Gone with the wind  
The gladness that filled my heart  
  
Just like a flame  
Love burned brightly then became  
An empty smoke dream that has gone  
Gone with the wind  
  
Gone, gone, gone with the wind  
Just like a leaf that has blown away  
Gone with the wind  
My romance has flown away  
Yesterday's kisses are still, still on my lips  
I've had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips  
  
But now all-all is gone  
Gone is the rapture that fills my heart  
Gone with the wind  
The gladness that filled my heart  
  
Just like a flame  
Love burned brightly then became  
An empty smoke dream that has  
Gone with the wind  
  
Gone with the wind



(jerry fuller)  
  
I see you now, I think of then  
And dwell upon the happiness of way back when  
Cause since you said goodbye  
The feelings just won't die  
And I still long to hold you now and then  
  
A million years have come and gone  
And I was sure by now I'd make it on my own  
But seeing you today  
Took my breath away  
And I still long to hold you now and then  
  
Suddenly I felt myself wondering  
If you might wanna try it again  
And though I wanted so much to hold you  
You smiled and shook my hand  
  
So i'll exist on dreams again  
On days when we were lovers and not just friends  
And even if I find another love in time  
I still long to hold you now and then  
  
Oh, I still long to hold you now and then



When you hear twin fiddles and a steel guitar  
You're listenin' to the sound of the American heart  
And opry music on a Saturday night  
Brings a smile to your face and a tear to your eye  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Sing a song about the Heartland  
The only place I feel at home  
Sing about the way a good man  
Works until the daylight's gone  
Sing the rain on the roof on a summer night  
Where they still know wrong from right  
Sing a song about the Heartland  
Sing a song about my life



Have a drink they're buying,  
Bottom of, bottle of denial,  
  
Big guy, big eye, watching me,  
Have to wonder what it sees,  
Progress, laced with, ramifications,  
Freedom's big plunge.  
  
Pull the innocent from a crowd,  
Raise the sticks then bring 'em down ,  
If they fail to obey,  
If they fail to obey.  
  
For every tool they lend us, a loss of independence.  
  
I pledge to my grievance to the flag,  
Cause you don't give blood, then take it back again,  
We're deserving of much more.  
  
Progress, taste it, invest-it-all,  
Champagne breakfast for everyone.  
  
Break the innocent when they're proud,  
Raise the stakes, then bring 'em down,  
If they fail to obey,  
If they fail to obey.  
  
Pledge my grievance to the flag,  
Aw come on, don't give blood, then take it back again,  
We're all deserving something more.  
  
I want to breathe, part of the seen,  
I want to taste, everyone I see,  
I want to run, when I'm up high,  
I want to run to the sea,  
I only want life to be,  
I just want to be,  
I will feel alive as long as I am free.



Hey Mr. Jack  
Is that the mouthwash in your eyes?  
Hey Mr. Jack  
Is that the cause of your surprise?

It seems like only yesterday  
I embraced the eternal flame  
I wanna know if I am, I am only ashes  
If the sun should shine on me  
  
I wanna taste  
What your life has to offer  
The longing, the lonely  
At Collinwood, at Collinwood  
  
Feel the wind grow stronger  
See the full moon rise  
Casting its dark shadows  
The beast will feed tonight  
  
Feel the wind grow stronger  
As the pale moon rose  
Casting its dark shadows  
For whom the bell will toll

I never in my life met a girl so low  
Sneakin' out the back door of my house below  
The fog is creepin' in and the moon is full  
I do believe she find what she's lookin' for  
And you know there's gonna be  
Showdown  
You better get ready  
Showdown  
I'm gonna shoot for the heart  
Showdown  
Put your cards on the table  
We're heading for the showdown tonight  
That little girl treat me so mean  
Wicked like the devil in tight blue jeans  
Here I sit with my head hung low  
Waiting for the woman come through that door  
Showdown  
You better get ready  
Showdown  
I'm gonna shoot for the heart  
Showdown  
Put your cards on the table  
We're heading for the showdown tonight  
It won't be easy  
Showdown  
I said it won't be nice  
Showdown  
So you better get ready  
Get ready for the showdown  
Easy come and easy go  
It used to work for me  
But not any more  
If she wants to spend her time with me  
She better know what lovin's for  



In Napoli beside the sea  
It happened on a night like this  
In Napoli our hearts were free  
And we surrendered to a kiss  
There 'neath the stars I saw heaven in her eyes  
There 'neath the stars I knew this was paradise  
All through the night in sweet delight  
We shared the tenderness of love  
But with the dawn my love was gone  
Just like the fading stars above  
My lonely heart cries out please come back to me  
Beside the sea in dear old Napoli  
There 'neath the stars I saw heaven in her eyes  
There 'neath the stars I knew this was paradise  
All through the night in sweet delight  
We shared the tenderness of love  
But with the dawn my love was gone  
Just like the fading stars above  
My lonely heart cries out please come back to me  
Beside the sea in dear old Napoli



Ah, don't you know, I've been on my own  
But I'm coming home.  
And I'd like you to be there,  
I feel a little cold in the air,  
And you're not anywhere.  
You're just another face, I used to know.  
But there is still a chance to hold on to our love,  
Cause I gave you everything, everything I had.  
  
Ooh, like it or not  
You have done it this time  
And like it or not, I've had enough.  
  
Ooh, like it or not  
There's a lot I could say  
Cause I've got a lot on my mind.  
  
It won't be very long  
You're just another face  
That I once used to know  
And I gave you everything,  
But what have I got to show? Oh Oh  
  
Oh, like it or not  
You are out on the street  
And like it or not  
That's where you will stay.  
  
Oh, like it or not  
There's another thing darling,  
Well I just could not stand another day  
Cause if you want to know,  
That there is still a chance to hold on to our love  
Cause I gave you everything  
Everything I had - everything I had.  
  
It's been a long, been a long long time  
Since I held anybody, since I loved anyone.  
Oh it's been a long, been a long long long time  
But if I'm right or if I'm wrong, does it matter anyway?  
  
It's been a long long long long time  
Since I held anybody, since I loved anyone.  
Ooh it's been a long long long long time  
But if I'm right or if I'm wrong, does it matter anyway?  
  
Ooh it's been a long long long long time  
Since I held anybody, since I loved anyone.  
Oh it's been a long, been a long long long time  
I'm right, if I'm wrong, does it matter anyway?  
  
It's been a long long, long long long time  
Since I held anybody, since I held anyone.



Pardon me boy is this the Chattanooga Choo Choo  
Track twenty nine boy you can give me a shine  
I can't afford to board the Chattanooga Choo Choo  
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare  
(You leave the Pennsylvania Station 'bout a quarter to four  
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore  
Dinner in the diner nothin' could be finer than to have your ham and eggs in
Carolina)  
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar  
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far  
Shovel all the coal in gotta keep a rollin' ooh ohh Chattanooga there you are  
There's gonna be a certain party in the station  
Satin and lace I used to call funny face  
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam  
So Chattanooga Choo Choo won't you choo choo me home  
(Chattanooga Choo Choo won't you choo choo me home)



Today I stumbled from my bed  
With thunder crashing in my head,  
My pillow still wet  
From last night's tears  
As I think of giving up  
A voice inside my coffee cup  
Kept crying out  
Ringing in my ears  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't cry, daddy  
Daddy, please don't cry  
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy  
And together we'll find a brand new mommy  
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again  
Daddy, ride us on your back again  
Oh, daddy  
Please  
Don't cry  
  
Why are children always first  
To feel the pain and the hurt the worst  
It's true but somehow  
It just don't seem right  
'Cause every time I cry I know  
It hurts my little children so I wonder  
Will it be the same tonight  
  
[Chorus:x2]  
Oh, daddy, please don't cry



[Verse:]  
  
I thought I lost, but actually I won  
For by his blood we all have overcome  
There is no failure, our God can never loose  
And that same power, it now belongs to You  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now it, s time to celebrate all banners raised  
(I've got the victory, the victory)  
Because the devil is defeated and God be praised  
(I've got the victory, the victory)  
Every situation I face, I win  
(I've got the victory, the victory)  
And everything works for my good in the end  
(I've got the victory, the victory)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
  
I was on my way to a burning hell  
The devil, he had my life set up to fail  
But thanks be to my God who causes me to triumph, overcome, tread upon the
enemy  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
  
Sombody who's listening right now you think You're losing  
You feel like you can't win 'cause You tried everything  
Greater is He that is within You don't doubt  
'Cause whatever You're in now, God says  
You have to come out  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
  
[Chorus:]



[Intro]  
Mmmm yeah.  
Mmmm yeah.  
  
[Verse 1]  
People thought all animals  
Arrived here unrelated  
The world began, and then came man  
All perfectly created  
  
[Verse 2]  
But then someone looked up a tree.  
And said "That monkey looks just like me!"  
So it really was a mystery  
What I'd learned in natural history!  
  
[Verse 3]  
So I joined HMS Beagle  
Watched the eagle and the seagull  
We studied rock and plants  
Flowers, trees and bees and ants  
  
[Verse 4]  
Slept on hammocks without pillows  
Eating rats and armadillos  
Till I realised on reflec-tion  
It's natural selection! Yeah!  
  
[Verse 5]  
Natural selection means  
Each animal evolved  
To blend with its surroundings  
Ch-ch-changes were involved  
  
[Verse 6]  
So birds with different, foods to seek.  
Seem to have developed, different beaks.  
  
[Verse 7]  
And over time they'd,  
Modified  
So just the fittest  
Of them all survived!  
  
[Verse 8]  
On the Isles of Galapagos  
I noted the giant tortoise  
Had interesting shells  
And I rode on them as well  
  
[Verse 9]  
Iguanas land and swimming  
Meant my new theory was winning  
It all led in the direction  
Of natural selection.  
  
[Verse 10]  
My findings went with outrage  
From the ch-ch-ch-ch-church of England  
And from me.  
  
[Verse 11]  
The idea that we came from ch-ch-chimps  
Questioned my own Christianity  
But it was hard to disagree!  
  
[Verse 12]  
Every species new mutation  
Had a perfect explanation  
It seems the worlds inception  
Must predate common perception  
  
[Verse 13]  
And if lack of adaptation  
Means a fatal limitation  
So each creature's imperfection  
Over time gets a correction  
  
[Verse 14]  
Meaning animal collections  
Grow unique means of protection  
And to fail nature's inspection  
Means immediate rejection  
Which all leads to the detec-tion  
Of natural selection!  
Natural selection!



Met my match today  
Felt the blood rushing and mingling  
A curious and enigmatic thing now  
Spiders in my dreams  
Synchronicity weaves like a web when  
You were meant to be a meal  
  
I want you so bad  
I want you so bad  
I understand why they say  
High school never ends  
  
Ill never act my age  
But you can tell byu the lines in my smile  
That I have been around for a while  
So insecurities  
Are about as useful as trying  
To put the pin back in the grenade  
  
I want you so bad  
I want you so bad  
I understand why they say  
High school never ends  
  
This isn't coincidence  
There's no such thing  
This isn't coincidence  
There's no such thing  
No such thing



No need to wonder  
Do you belong?  
No need to worry  
You can be strong  
  
Don't disbelieve it  
Let your fears go  
There must be more to this life  
And we all know  
  
The solution  
Staring you down  
Looking for  
The solution  
Bringing you 'round  
  
Round and round we go  
Round and round we go  
  
The past can haunt your future so  
Shadows are falling look out below  
  
Voices are calling echoes unknown  
There must be more to this life than we all know  
  
Looking for  
The solution  
Staring you down  
Deep inside  
The solution  
Bringing you 'round  
  
Giving it out  
Giving it out  
Do the best that you can do  
Giving it out  
Giving it out  
It's all up to you  
  
Giving it out  
Giving it out  
Do the best that you can do  
Giving it out  
Giving it out  
It's all up to you  
  
It's all up to you  
  
Over and under and down we go  
(Down we go)  
Caught at the crossroads  
Which way to go?  
(Path unknown)  
Choosing the right path?  
Only you know  
  
Looking for  
The solution  
You hold the key  
Deep inside  
The solution  
Set yourself free  
  
Round and round we go  
Round and round we go  
  
Giving in, giving out  
Do the best you can do  
Giving in, giving out  
It's all up to you  
  
Giving in, giving out  
Do the best you can do  
Giving in, giving out  
It's all up to you  
  
It's all up to you  
It's all up to you



I can't imagine why you say the things you do  
Maybe in time I'll understand  
What is the reason for the emptiness you feel  
When I'm trying everything I can  
  
My love is running deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
It's a fire burning bright  
And it's always been this way  
  
Can you hear me?  
Am I really coming through?  
Why do your eyes seem to dance away?  
I know what's right for you, haven't I always?  
I need you more than I can say  
  
My love is running deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
It's a fire burning bright  
And it's always been this way  
  
My love is running deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
It's a fire burning bright  
And it's always been this way  
  
And I'll never ever change  
In my life time, I'll stay the same  
Yes I'll never, I'll never change  
I'll love you, I'll stay the same  
  
My love is running  
[Deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
Fire burning bright  
And it keeps on growing  
Keeps on growing]  



Time will come when we know what happened here  
Change will come in time and make it clear  
We learn one thing if we learn at all  
In the secret wars we call our lives, anything can happen  
We watch the days, we make our plans  
We change in ways, a life demands  
But whatever pleasure this life may allow  
I'll give you the love I have for you now  
Because anything can happen in a world so full of fear  
Dreams are whispered in the dead of night and people disappear  
But you hear my heart and you know I'm still here  
Although you know and I know you know  
While I swear I'll never let you go, anything can happen  
Yeah, if this love can happen here  
Anything can  
We watch the days, we make our plans  
We change in ways a life demands  
I'll always remember this time, this place  
The hope in your voice, the light on your face  
Because anything can happen in a world so full of pain  
People give their lives to making war and we call those people sane  
But I love you where your dreams remain  
Though you never say it anymore  
One day there'll be an end to this war and who knows  
We may see what we're here for, anything can happen  
Yeah, if this love has found us here  
Anything can, it can happen  
Anything can, anything can happen  
Anything, anything, anything, anything  



Teardrops running down your face  
Teardrops running down your face  
Diamonds of water, and salt from your body  
Coming down to meet my kisses  
  
Teardrops running down your face  
Teardrops running down your face  
Staining your skin and my skin and beginning  
The stories that you can't begin  
  
The way I feel could be despised  
But its a vision that I prize  
Teardrops  
Teardrops  
  
I'm not trying to make you feel pain  
Or joy to make the tears flow  
But when they roll unashamed  
They move me so  
  
Teardrops running down your face  
Teardrops running down your face  
Let me, let me brush them with my fingers  
Comfort you and say its alright  
  
It's so strong this way I feel  
Sometimes I want to beg or steal  
Teardrops  
Teardrops.



Wash away the thoughts inside  
That keep my mind away from you  
No more love and no more pride  
And thoughts are all I have to do  
  
Remember when it rained  
I felt the ground and look up high  
And called your name  
Remember when it rained  
In the darkness I remain  
  
Tears of hope run down my skin  
Tears for you that will not dry  
They magnify the one within  
And let the outside slowly die  
  
Remember when it rained  
I felt the ground and looked up high  
And called your name  
Remember when it rained  
In the water I remain  
  
Running down



Your kind of woman gotta heart of stone  
But watch it break when I get you alone  
Take a chance, come lay down with me  
Oh, I wanna make it  
  
Slow and steady never lost the race  
Don't stop runnin', I'm a fool for the chase  
Play the game, surrender to me  
Baby, I don't wanna fake it  
  
Is it any wonder, you got me comin' under fire?  
Comin' like thunder, you know you make me walk the wire  
  
It's so easy to put on a show  
Your body says yes but you won't let it go  
But my passion it won't slip away  
  
You got me, I'm cornered, my back to the wall  
No bed of roses, ain't no bed at all  
I'm walkin' the wire, I stumble and fall  
I got the message but I ain't gonna crawl



Love's been here and gone  
But the mem'ry keeps holding on  
Now I know how love is if I can live through this  
Love's been here and gone  
When there's love your heart is strong  
But it weakens when love goes wrong  
Now I've known that power dealt the parting hour  
Love's been here and gone  
I've loved once but never again a closed heart just won't let love in  
Hopin' only to you oh what can I do love's been here and gone  
[ piano ]  
I've loved once but never again...  
  
  



I'm alive again  
Darkness far behind me  
I'm invincible  
Despair will never find me  
  
I feel strong  
I've got a new sense of elation  
Boundless energy  
Euphoria fixation  
  
Still talk to just get by  
Seems so meaningless to try  
When all I want to do is cry  
Who would ever know I felt so sad  
  
'Cause even though I get so high  
I know that I will never fly  
And when I fall out of the sky  
Who'll be standing by?  
(Will you be standing by?)



A legacy so far removed,  
One day will be improved.  
Eternal rights we left behind,  
We were the better kind.  
  
Two the same, set free too,  
I always looked to you,  
I always looked to you,  
I always looked to you.  
  
We fought for good, stood side by side,  
Our friendship never died.  
On stranger waves, the lows and highs,  
Our vision touched the sky,  
  
Immortalists with points to prove,  
I put my trust in you.  
I put my trust in you.  
I put my trust in you.  
  
A house somewhere on foreign soil,  
Where ageless lovers call,  
Is this your goal, your final needs,  
Where dogs and vultures eat,  
Committed still I turn to go.  
  
I put my trust in you.  
I put my trust in you.  
I put my trust in you.  
I put my trust in you.  
In you. In you. In you.  
Put my trust in you, in you.



Yeah, election time's comin'  
Who you gon' vote for?  
Yeah  
  
If I was President  
I'd get elected on Friday  
Assassinated on Saturday  
Buried on Sunday  
They go back to work on Monday  
  
If I was President  
If I was President  
If I was President  
  
Instead of spendin' billions on the war  
I can use that money, so I can feed the poor  
Cause I know some so poor  
When it rains, that's when they shower  
Screamin', "Fight the power"  
That's when the vulture devoured  
  
If I was President  
I'd get elected on Friday  
Assassinated on Saturday  
Buried on Sunday  
They go back to work on Monday  
  
If I was President  
If I was President  
If I was President  
  
I know some soldiers  
That sleep, but they can't dream  
Wake up with screams  
Sounds of M-16s  
So take this medal of honor  
For your bravery  
I wish you the best kid  
You and your family  
  
If I was President  
I'd get elected on Friday  
Assassinated on Saturday  
Buried on Sunday  
They go back to work on Monday  
  
If I was President  
If I was President  
If I was President  
  
But the radio won't play this  
They call it rebel music  
How can you refuse it  
Children of Moses?  
  
Tell the children the truth, the truth  
It's not all that bling, that's diamonds  
Tell them the truth, the truth  
Most of y'all wear cubic zirconium  
Tell them the truth, the truth, yeah  
Your soul is worth more than diamonds and gold  
  
If I was President, all Blacks will have reparation, no segregation  
Feed the nation 'til there is no famine  
Muslims, Jews, Christians would all hold hands  
Every week on the beach, party by the sand, word up  
  
Take trips on Air Force One  
No need to bring the homeless  
With no sneaks to Air Force One  
Better schools in the hood  
Better teachers for the classes  
Makin' money, payin' no taxes  
  
Find the best scientists, tell 'em  
"Come up with the answer  
I want the cure for AIDS and Cancer"  
But I gotta watch my back  
Snipers on the hill, with the steel  
Man power, waitin' to JF kill  
  
If I was President  
I'd get elected on Friday  
Assassinated on Saturday  
Buried on Sunday  
They go back to work on Monday  
  
If I was President  
If I was President  
  
I feel a ring comin'  
Let me play my guitar for them right now  
Let's go  
Refugees  
Yeah



[Verse 1:]  
Pummeled from the moment you wake a void of confusion 24 hours a day  
Twisted reality eternal debate the clouds are flowing something?s going to
break.  
Deliver me it will deliver you, faceless masses of grey and blue  
The sky is falling a rain of blood  
The soul?s are empty above  
  
[Chorus:]  
Strange Daze- it?s hard to accept  
Strange ways- you never expect  
Strange daze-Nothing makes sense  
Strange Daze trying to make sense of it all  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Loss of balance with an axe to grind  
People talking with nothing really on their minds  
No provocation, no sparks to the flame  
Investigations with nothing left say  
Remember me, I won?t remember you  
Dogs are howling over what you do  
Skin is crawling you embrace your self I?m not feeling too well



The world wanders with me tonight  
  
Little steps I take with you  
I follow your heart and I follow the moon  
So hidden far away from me  
The world wanders with us tonight  
  
Ahhh if only far away from here existed  
A place where to discover my heart  
  
To know if it can love you or not  
  
And it will wander and it will wander  
This heart of mine along with you  
And the earth will wander  
My life will wander and yes yes one day it will understand  
  
It's you who wanders with me tonight  
It's you who wanders far from here  
But yes I know that you are my moon  
Something you show, something you don't  
  
There are blue roads in the sky  
There are eyes, and the sky is already there  
Yes, I think this is the stars  
Ahh, if I could stop like this  
  
And it will wander, and it will wander  
My heart far from you  
And the earth will wander  
My life will wander and one day yes, yes it will understand  
  
Heart already far away  
Yes you are the moon  
If only I could discover it in the sky  
  
And it will wander, and it will wander  
Yes it will wander this heart of mine  
And the earth will wander, my life will wander  
And one day yes it will understand  
And one day yes it will understand you



Before I fall too fast  
Kiss me quick but make it last  
So I can see how badly this will hurt me when you say goodbye  
  
Keep it sweet  
Keep it slow  
Let the future pass but don't let go  
But tonight I could fall too soon into this beautiful moonlight  
  
But you're so hypnotizing  
You've got me laughing while I sing  
You've got me smiling in my sleep  
And I can see this unraveling  
Your love is where I'm falling  
So please don't catch me  
  
See this heart won't settle down  
Like a child running scared from a clown  
I'm terrified of what you do  
My stomach screams just when I look at you  
  
Run far away so I can breathe  
Even though you're far from suffocating me  
But I can't get my hopes too high  
'Cause every hello ends with a goodbye  
  
But you're so hypnotizing  
You've got me laughing while I sing  
You've got me smiling in my sleep  
And I can see this unraveling  
Your love is where I'm falling  
So please don't catch me  
  
Now you see why I'm scared  
I can't open up my heart without care  
So here I go  
It's what I feel  
For the first time in my life I know it's real  
  
But you're so hypnotizing  
You've got me laughing while I sing  
You've got me smiling in my sleep  
And I can see this unraveling  
Your love is where I'm falling  
So please don't catch me  
  
If this is love please don't break me  
I'm giving up so just catch me

Weak and strong, everyone

Happiest girl I ever knew  
Happiest girl I ever knew  
  
Wanted to feel the joy  
Flow between our lips  
Wanted to feel the joy  
Flow between our hips  
  
Happiest girl I ever knew  
Why do you smile the smile you do  
  
Happiest girl I ever knew  
Wanted to feel the joy  
Pass between our eyes  
Wanted to feel the joy  
Pass between our thighs  
  
And I would have to pinch her  
Just to see if she was real  
Just to watch the smile fade away  
And see the pain she'd feel  
  
Wanted to feel her joy  
Feel it deep within  
Wanted to feel her joy  
Penetrate my skin  
  
Happiest girl I ever knew  
Why do you smile the smile you do  



I've got myself  
In a masochistic hold  
Why don't you let go  
Shake it off  
Just to redirect my flow  
Come on let's go  
  
Sit up straight  
I'm on a double date  
I've got to find my way  
Into the light, heavy, middle weight  
We don't stop rock around the clock  
Motor mouthing off  
In front of every other road block  
  
Come again and tell me  
What you're going through  
Like a girl who only knew  
Her child was due  
  
Memories of everything  
Of lemon trees on mercury  
Come to me with remedies  
From five or six of seven seas  
You always took me with a smile  
When I was down  
Memories of everything  
That blew through  
  
Looking up into  
A reverse vertigo  
What an undertow  
Give it up  
Another stubborn scorpio  
Come on, let's go  
  
Sit up straight  
I'm on a double date  
I've got to find my way  
Into the light, heavy, middle weight  
We don't stop rock around the clock  
Motor mouthing off  
In front of every other road block  
  
Come again and tell me  
What you're going through  
Like a girl who only knew  
Her child was due  
To the moon she gave  
Another good review  
Turn around and look at me  
It's really really you



Chorus x2:  
Who you gonna call when it's time to brawl  
Standin round waitin for my queendom to fall  
Well I think not, styles are pipin hot  
Blazin, amazin, I give it all I got  
  
I'm tellin you straight up, all sleepin beauties better wake up  
Ill tear your state up, so set the date up  
And I'm a rip it, what if it what was it  
Who did it, who does it  
From private to public  
Anywhere I'm in there and been there  
So recognize this, who the nicest  
Sit down and settle for your constellation prizes  
Whatever you want I got  
Whether you ready or not  
Its about to get hot when I drop  
So notes, pause another spot  
To do you, don't get me in a corner make me do you  
Don't try to be me, do you  
Be coo to you and do you  
I'm on a higher level with different class, another plane  
I am the queen, that's my name, time to explain  
That I spit game with dames  
Leave em all with shit stains  
Split frames, hopin you hopin that I'm jokin  
Don't know but still blink off like for-fos  
But so-so, slow mos comin in like the po-pos  
Don't want rocks comin at me the wrong way  
Packin much rocks, it's gonna be a long day  
And for real, spittin on imbessiles and spinnin wheels  
On my 600 you want it, you must be blunted  
Ill take it to your stomach, run it, give me all  
Mic for mic, steppin to me you gonna fall, we brawl  
Throwin a two-piece so loose leafs  
Its the q-you-double-e-n  
You know how I'm mcin  
  
Chorus x2  
  
See physically you not ready  
Lyrically you not ready  
Mentally maybe  
Who talks tough, time to get the baby  
No threats or small bets on my bond we can get it on  
From dusk til dawn from night til mourn  
Some bubble hard squads are gone, no gimmicks, no tricks  
Til one of us admits it's a battle a whisk  
So look I'm off the hook, while you off the rocker  
Thinkin I'm shook, get the phone book, call the doctor  
Are you out of your mind, doubtin mines, out of line  
Talkin out your behind, shoutin rhymes out of time  
Its all over, what's up, yeah, what, what now, you tough now  
Now you hush, hush now, aint sayin too much now  
Thought so, haunt yo sleepin ass, creepin fast  
Like you was doin somethin, now I gotta ruin somethin  
You image, your career, lookie here you whole life is hangin in the air  
Like a chandilier, poppin off like a can of beer, understand is it clear  
If not let me put it in your ear that I'm royalty  
Even though I'm low-key, you know me  
You be singin over my tracks like it's kareoke  
If you don't know the half you gon feel the wrath  
Represent the rugged path, the flavor unit staff  
Droppin mathmatics, layin you out like craftmatic  
Ill let you have it, so you don't want the static  
  
Chorus x2



Well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
Wake up in the morning, fold my hands, pray for rain  
Got a head full of ideas, that are drivin' me insane  
It's a shame the way they makes me scrub the floor  
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  
Hands you a nickel, hands you a dime  
Asks you with a grin if you're havin' a good time  
Then he fines you every time you slam the door  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more  
  
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more  
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more  
Well, she talks to the servants about man and God and law  
Everybody knows she's the brains behind pa  
She's sixty eight, says she's twenty four  
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more  
  
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more  
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's father no more  
He puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks  
Bedroom window is made out of bricks  
The national guard hangs 'round his door  
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's father no more  
  
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more  
Try my level best to be just like I am  
Everybody wants me to be just like them  
They sing while you slave and I just get bored  
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more



I escaped my final moment  
But it's turning back at me  
On every corner I can feel it waiting  
Just a moment, no awareness  
I could easily slip away  
And then I'll be gone forever  
  
I'm searching,  
I'm fighting for a way to get through  
To turn it away  
  
It's waiting, always trying  
I feel the hands of fate, they're suffocating  
Tell me what's the reason  
Is it all inside my head  
Can't take it no more!  
  
All around me I see danger  
And it's closing in on me  
Every second I can hear it breathing  
I can't stand the fear inside me  
Cause it's leading me astray  
And it will be my ending  
  
I'm searching  
I'm fighting for a way to get through  
To turn it away  
  
It's waiting, always trying  
I feel the hands of fate, they're suffocating  
Tell me what's the reason  
Is it all inside my head  
Can't take it no more!  
  
But no one faced what's coming my way  
And I will let my fear fade away  
Whatever may be, I'll have to find out  
  
It's waiting, always trying  
I feel the hands of fate, they're suffocating  
Tell me what's the reason  
Is it all inside my head  
Can't take it no more



You take a piece of me every time you leave  
And never realize the way I feel about you  
But my tongue gets tied and my mouth gets dry  
I wanna tell you but I don't know how to  
  
So every night I dream (I dream)  
Hope and pray and believe  
That someday you'll be mine (I know)  
We'll live in ectascy - the world for you and me  
  
One love - one life  
Everything would be alright if I was your lover  
One soul - one mind  
Everything could be so right if I was your lover  
  
Another day goes by and I'd lose my mind  
If I didn't know that you were meant for me  
Under moonlit night, when the time is right  
You'll hold me in your arms from then on to infinity  
  
And every night I'll dream (I dream)  
Hope and pray and believe  
So happy that you're mine (I know)  
We'll live in ectascy - the world for you and me  
  
One love - one life  
Everything would be alright if I was your lover  
One soul - one mind  
Everything could be so right if I was your lover  



Let me teach you

The kama sutra way  
Come and teach me  
What love has taught you  
Come and please me  
The kama sutra way  
It's crazy  
How I can tell you understand  
Givin my love a second chance  
I've broken trust that we once had  
I need you  
It's doesn't matter what's done before  
I know it's time for me to close that door  
I always knew that you'd be back for more  
Move your body baby with me  
Kama sutra baby with me

The imagination so wild and new  
You doing things you said you couldn't do  
Holding positions til we both get it through  
now I like it  
My imagination so wild and new  
I'm doing things I never thought I could do  
Holding positions til we both get it through  
how you love me  
Pleasing my body baby as you want  
It's the beginning dance into the dawn  
Love's a bridge and it's time to jump  
  
  



One light shining bright, it's made from many colors  
Just like every ocean's made from many drops of rain  
One soul takes many shapes, to make up the human race  
One fire, many lives share the same sun every day  
  
Old beliefs let us down, many roads lead to heaven  
One love, many faiths all share the world in search of grace  
Across the universe, the same force that moves the earth's  
In my heart, makes me whole, wash my doubt and fear away  
  
In a big deep blue sky on a beautiful day  
For the moment is now, there's perfection in every way  
  
Feel it flow from me  
Tantra my eyes can see  
Where we all belong  
Tantra watch over me  
  
Like a bird on a wing like the eye of a storm  
There's a circle of life when every child's born  
I get caught up in time lose all reality  
A prisoner of my own design  
Where my freedom is where I choose to be  
  
Look for some kind of sign from the heaven's above  
I hear one voice, I am the love I choose to love  
  
Feel it flow through me  
Tantra, my eyes can see  
Where we all belong  
Tantra, watch over me  
  
Like roses in bloom  
Like a Mountaintop majesty  
Like an orange harvest moon  
Wonders for all to see  
  
Look for some kind of sign from the heaven's above  
I hear one voice, I am the love I choose to love  
oh yeah  
  
Feel it flow through me  
Tantra, my eyes can see  
Where we all belong  
Tantra, watch over me  
  
Feel it flow through me  
Tantra, watch over me



I can't budge baby I can't move without your love to guide me  
I don't know honey that's the truth what laid you down beside me,  
Heat me with your love oh, your lips were meant for mine  
Nobody else can bake me like a, no no no, like a  
Bonfire, your love is like a bonfire burning deep within me  
Now some folks said it's no good to smoke in bed  
Um, but I just turn off my ears and I jump into the fire again  
  
I feel so weak, yea, I can't sleep without you there to hold me  
Promise me you won't ever leave or I would die so coldly,  
Kiss me with your eyes, please don't let it rain  
Don't kick no dust on my  
Bonfire, your love is like a bonfire burning deep within me  
Now it just grows, no matter where the wind blows  
Yeah but since you touched me I can't hide it  
I've been so delighted with you  
  
Yeah, heat me with your love, ah ah  
You opened up my heart, I just can't live without you,  
Oh, I just couldn't live another day, your my  
Bonfire, your love is like a bonfire burning deep within me  
Now some folks said it's no good to smoke in bed uh, huh  
But I just take off my clothes and I jump into the fire again



Can't you feel our souls ignite  
Shedding ever changing colours, in the darkness of the fading night,  
Like the river joins the ocean, as the germ in a seed grows  
We have finally been freed to get back home.  
  
There's an angel standing in the sun, and he's crying with a loud voice,  
"This is the supper of the mighty one",  
Lord of Lords,  
King of Kings,  
Has returned to lead his children home,  
To take them to the new Jerusalem.



Hey, little tomboy, sit here on my lap  
I got things that I gotta tell you  
No more skateboards, put away your baseball mitt.  
Your rough livin' days are through  
You could find places to go  
You could see that boys love you so  
They're doin' it all over the world  
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy  
Time to turn into a girl  
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy  
They're doin' it all over the world  
Hey, little tomboy, I've had my eyes on you  
Thinkin' what a girl you could be  
Mmm, I smell perfume, let's try some cut-off jeans  
Look at all the changes I see  
I'm gonna teach you to kiss  
You're gonna feel just like this  
They're doin' it all over the world  
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy  
Time to turn into a girl

(Hey little hey little hey little tomboy)  
You'd make a beautiful girl  
(Hey little hey little hey little tomboy)  
They're doing it all over the world  
  



You used to raise your voice so that it could be heard.  
You used to shout out your orders, and your word was the final word.  
Do as I say and not as I do.  
They've taken your picture off the wall.  
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?  
  
You used to chase your women right into your home.  
You used to tell them you loved them over the telephone.  
Now they all see through you  
And you're sinking like a stone.  
No one's knocking at your door,  
No one calls,  
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?  
  
You're sad and disgusted,  
Is what you've grown up to be.  
Bet you had no idea what your dream would turn out to be.  
But when you live for yourself  
Hell, it's hard on everyone.  
But you did it your way and man you did it all.  
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?  
  
Now you did it your way and man, you did it all.  
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all?



Sometimes I feel like I don't know  
Sometimes I feel like checkin' out  
I want to get it wrong  
Can't always be strong  
And love it won't be long...  
  
Oh sugar, don't you cry  
Oh child, wipe the tears from your eyes  
You know I need you to be strong  
And the day is as dark as the night is long  
Feel like trash, you make me feel clean  
I'm in the black, can't see or be seen  
  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
(Alright now)  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
  
You bury your treasure  
Where it can't be found  
But your love is like a secret  
That's been passed around  
There is a silence that comes to a house  
Where no one can sleep  
I guess it's the price of love  
I know it's not cheap  
  
(Oh, come on)  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
(Oh, come on)  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
  
Oh... Ultraviolet...  
Ultraviolet...  
Ultraviolet...  
Ultraviolet...  
  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
  
I remember  
When we could sleep on stones  
Now we lie together  
In whispers and moans  
When I was all messed up  
And I had opera in my head  
Your love was a light bulb  
Hanging over my bed  
  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
(Oh, come on)  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
  
Ultraviolet...  
[Repeat 4 times]  
  
Baby, baby, baby...  
Baby, baby, baby...  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way  
[Repeat 3 times]  
  
Baby, baby, baby... Light my way

Makeshift poison words, they' mean nothin'  
Twist sideways  
Aim my way  
Now pull the trigger and watch me ricochet  
You shot the shot without making a sound  
You said you cared a lot, but I see through you now  
Go on, throw your weight around  
I won't buckle, I will let you down  
  
Let's go, come on  
You ain't shit and I'll prove you wrong  
Let's go, come on

Let's go, come on  
You ain't shit, as we scream along  
Whoa oh  
  
Let's go, come on  
You ain't shit and I'll take you on!



The only thing that 'll move me now is a fast song  
Song long and barely known  
And I don't wanna hear no crying all gone wrong song.  
Kick it off and let's all pick a fast song.  
Now don't go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune,  
Stay away from all that moon and june sprune groome tune.  
Throw me one that's flying and I'll hang on.  
I'll come in on my part on a fast song.  
Dideldiedie...  
  
Well it don't have to have a banjo or mandelin  
But let it in, if it wants in.  
Keep the rosin' handed and the horse there tough and tight.  
Pick it up and I'm lyable to pick all night.  
Now don't go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune,  
Stay away from all that moon and june sprune groome tune.  
Throw me one that's flying and I'll hang on.  
I'll come in on my part on a fast song.  
Repeat last verse, but a little faster.



(Traditional)  
Away in a manger no crib for a bed the little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet
head  
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay the little Lord Jesus asleep on
the hay  
  
[ vibes ]  
The cattle are lowing the baby awakes but little Lord Jesus no crying he makes  
I love our Lord Jesus look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh  
  
[ vibes ]  
Away in a manger no crib for a bed...



There's a lot of tension in this town  
I know it's building up inside of me  
I've got all the symptoms and the side effects  
Of city life anxiety  
I could never understand why the urban attitude  
Is so superior  
In a world of high rise ambition  
Most people's motives are ulterior  
Sometimes I feel as though I'm running on ice  
Paying the price too long  
Kind of get the feeling that I'm running on ice  
Where did my life go wrong  
I'm a cosmopolitan sophisticate  
Of culture and intelligence  
The culmination of technology  
And civilized experience  
But I'm carrying the weight of all the useless junk  
A modern man accumulates  
I'm a statistic in a system  
That a civil servant dominates  
And all that means is that I'm running on ice  
Caught in the vise so strong  
I'm slipping and sliding, cause I'm running on ice  
Where did my life go wrong  
You've got to run  
You've got to run  
As fast as I can climb  
A new disaster every time I turn around  
As soon as I get one fire put out  
There's another building burning down  
They say this highway's going my way  
But I don't know where it's taking me  
It's a bad waste, a sad case, a rat race  
It's breaking me  
I get no traction cause I'm running on ice  
It's taking me twice as long  
I get a bad reaction cause I'm running on ice  
Where did my life go wrong  
You've got to run  
You've got to run  
Running on ice  
Running on ice  
Running on ice  
Running on ice  
  



[Chorus:]  
Got to have it,  
Yeah I made it  
I'm addicted  
  
[Eminem - Verse 1]  
This was a beat with no words at first, it's a blank painting  
Exercising the mind, it's brain strength training  
Starts off something like shady's an insane maniac  
Yeah slim shady that's a zany name aint it  
Now all you needs an image to go with the name, baby  
Wife beaters and white t-shirts  
Hanes mainly, it's a long shot but is it possible  
There's a lane maybe,  
If not, he's gonna have to come and change the whole game aint he  
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it  
He can see his name up in lights  
Women screaming his f-cking name feinting  
Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium  
Joe Shmoe made it, he took his plain Jane lady  
And his baby Hailey out the trailer  
But he aint trailing anymore he's ahead of the race  
While maintaining his innocence  
Little does he know his train is derailing  
And he's about to be raped by this game anally.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Got to have it,  
Yeah I made it  
I'm addicted  
  
[Eminem - Verse 2]  
You're operating on all cylinders  
Syllables spit like dillingers  
Spilling your guts  
People are feeling your mic skills  
But these haters are ice grillin' ya  
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life thye might steal from ya  
Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya  
But you can't decipher why for the life of ya  
It wasn't like this when you were cyphering  
Argue with your ife again  
She found vicodin in your pants last night again  
Your disputes public  
Nothings private anymore  
When your best friends say bye bye to him  
What kind of apple you take a bite of slim  
(But this is what you wanted Marshall aint it)  
F-ck no, the way that it turned out  
Was nothing like the picture that I painted in my head  
Sometimes a dream I make is more fun than to actually make it  
The game stripped me naked  
It robbed me of ever having another real relation-ship  
With another girl, this World is a f-cking trip  
As I slip in another world  
Proceed, take another hit  
Sniff til I f-cking url  
Tell em all to f-cking sit and spin til they f-cking twirl  
Middle finger up again  
Relapsing back in this game, oh well, f-ck it then  
  
[Chorus:]  
Got to have it,  
Yeah I made it  
I'm addicted



Ask and you won't be forgiven  
This is a blessing in disguise  
All of your choices are spoken  
You've killed the child in my eyes  
I'm gonna see you burn  
  
When in some dark distant future  
you'll meet my presence in a song  
You'll punch the walls in frustration  
Can you hear my voice and say I'm wrong?  
I'm gonna see you burn  
  
With the first light I touch your skin  
rise above the challenge, the day begins  
and the brightnessss runs to black  
fading in the darkness I'm not coming back  
  
Here we live and here now we die  
on this mountainside  
arms entwined, the chosen the brave  
fire wind to take you away like the wrath of God  
  
Ask and you won't be forgiven  
This is a blessing in disguise  
All of your choices are spoken  
You've killed the child in my eyes  
I'm gonna see you burn

Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans  
Way back up in the woods amongst the evergreens  
There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood  
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode  
That never ever learned to read and write so well  
But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell  
  
Go go. Go Johnny go  
Johnny B. Goode  
  
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack  
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track  
Old engineer sitting in the shade  
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made  
The people passing by would stop and say  
"Oh my but how that little country boy could play"  
  
Go go. Go Johnny go  
Johnny B. Goode  
  
His mother told him some day you will be a man  
And you will be the leader of a big old band  
Many people coming from miles around  
To hear you play your music till the sun goes down  
Maybe someday your name will be in lights, saying  
Johnny B. Goode tonight  
  
Go go. Go Johnny go  
Johnny B. Goode



You'll burn this time  
Seeing the violence  
It's feeding my mind  
No one is saving you  
How can you find  
A heaven in this hell?  
  
Leave it behind  
Hearing your silence  
It screams our goodbye  
Cannot believe it's an eye for an eye  
Life is gone to waste  
  
Angels have faith  
I don't want to be a part of his sin  
I don't want to get lost in his world  
I'm not playing this game  
  
When the shadows remain in the light of day  
On the wings of darkness he'll retaliate  
He'll be falling from grace  
Till the end of all his days  
  
From the ashes of hate  
It's a cruel demon's fate  
On the wings of darkness  
He's returned to stay  
There will be no escape  
'Cause he's fallen far from grace  
  
What have you done?  
Is this what you wanted?  
What have you become?  
His soul's not forsaken  
You're walking alone  
From heaven into hell  
Now that you know  
Your way in this madness  
Your powers are gone  
Your chains have been broken  
You've suffered so long  
You will never change.  
  
Angels have faith  
I don't want to be a part of his sin  
I don't want to get lost in his world  
I'm not playing this game  
  
When the shadows remain in the light of day  
On the wings of darkness  
He'll retaliate  
He'll be falling from grace  
Till the end of all his days  
  
From the ashes of hate  
It's a cruel demon's fate  
On the wings of darkness  
He's returned to stay  
There will be no escape  
'Cause he's fallen far from grace  
  
Angels have faith  
I don't want to be a part of his sin  
I don't want to get lost in his world  
I'm not playing this game  
  
When the shadows remain in the light of day  
On the wings of darkness  
He'll retaliate  
He'll be falling from grace  
Till the end of all his days  
  
From the ashes of hate  
It's a cruel demon's fate  
On the wings of darkness  
He's returned to stay  
There will be no escape  
'Cause he's fallen far from grace



Wishful crystal  
Water covers everything in blue  
Coolin' water  
Wishful sinful  
Our love is beautiful to see  
I know where I would like to be  
Right back where I came  
Wishful, sinful, wicked blue  
Water covers you  
Wishful, sinful, wicked you  
Can't escape the blue  
Magic risin'  
Sun is shinin' deep beneath the sea  
But not enough for you and me and sunshine  
Love to hear the wind cry  
Wishful sinful  
Our love is beautiful to see  
I know where I would like to be  
Right back where I came  
Wishful, sinful, wicked blue  
Water covers you  
Wishful, sinful, wicked you  
Can't escape the blue  
Love to hear the wind cry  
Love to hear you cry, yeah, yeah



I might be wrong  
I might be wrong  
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on  
  
I used to think  
I used to think  
There was no future left at all  
I used to think  
  
Start again begin again  
Let's go down the waterfall  
Think about the good times and never go back  
Never go back  
  
What would I do?  
What would I do?  
If I did not have you?  
  
Open up, let me in  
Let's go down the waterfall  
Have ourselves a good time  
It's nothing at all  
Nothing at all  
Nothing at all



She should have stayed away from friends  
She should have had more time to spend  
She should have died when she was born  
She should have worn the crown of thorns  
  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
  
She should have made her mother proud  
She should have stood out in the crowd  
She should have fallen on her stance  
She should have had another chance  
  
[Repeat x2]  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
  
She should have stayed away from friends  
She should have had more time to spend  
She should have died when she was born  
She should have worn the crown of thorns  
  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son  
She should have-been a son



There was trouble in the air  
Just a subtle hint of danger  
And a woman dressed in black  
Out lookin' for a stranger  
Well she took me to her room  
Where she offered me a wager  
She promised me the moon  
So I took a chance  
  
Yes I played the King of Hearts  
Put my cards out on the table  
I thought the odds were in my favor  
But she laid the Ace of Spades  
An' I wound up where I started  
The King of Hearts no more  
But the King of the Broken-hearted  
  
She cut the deck one more  
By the light of thirteen candles  
She said,



I don't care if you're leavin' on the train  
I think all of your music's done in vain  
And I don't care about the girls that you lay  
I'm not the one who sees you anyway  
You came to that  
If I can set you free  
Let that be  
Won't you let that be  
I don't care if you're going home  
I think all of your music's done all wrong  
And I don't care if you live in misery  
Things apparent are the things you just can't see  
You came to that  
If I can set you free  
Let that be  
Won't you let that be



Ignorance is bliss, ya know it's true  
Ignorance is bliss, just look at you  
Is it goin' anywhere?  
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, yeah!  
What's happening to our society?  
Disintegration of humanity  
Destruction of the environment  
Cram that cop donation in your ass  
  
Is it goin' anywhere?  
(?) Politicians to confuse you  
What's good for them, now it ain't good for you  
But there ain't nothing that you can do  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive,  
I'm alive, yeah!



Some say love it is a river  
That drowns the tender reed.  
Some say love it is a razor  
That leaves your soul to bleed.  
  
Some say love it is a hunger  
An endless, aching need  
I say love it is a flower,  
And you it's only seed.  
  
It's the heart afraid of breaking  
That never learns to dance  
It's the dream afraid of waking  
That never takes the chance  
  
It's the one who won't be taken,  
Who cannot seem to give  
And the soul afraid of dying  
That never learns to live.  
  
And the night has been too lonely  
And the road has been too long.  
And you think that love is only  
For the lucky and the strong.  
  
Just remember in the winter  
Far beneath the bitter snow  
Lies the seed that with the sun's love,  
In the spring, becomes a rose.



We hang tough  
When the chips are low  
Can't buy enough  
So we steal the show  
We get so hot  
We can't cool down  
So the hell with that  
We're rippin' through your town  
  
We've had enough of the raw deals  
Hit the road and tell ya how it feels  
  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
  
We live fast  
But we love it so  
Can't see the past  
But it's gone we know  
We get so hot  
We can't cool down  
So the hell with that  
We're burnin' through your town  
  
We've had enough of the raw deals  
Hit the road and tell ya how it feels  
  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Run like hell  
  
Hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels  
Like hell on wheels



Look at the way the flowers bloom for you,  
They want to show you their beauty, Lord  
Running waters dance,

You got the notion (I hope so)



Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today  
Madam...  
Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today  
  
She is sorry to be delayed,  
But last evening down at lovers lane, she strayed  
Madam...  
Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today  
  
When she woke from her dream  
And found that her love had gone  
Madam...  
She ran to the man  
Who had led her so far astray  
  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her lover down  
Madam...  
Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today  
  
Then the mob came and got her  
And dragged her from the jail  
Madam...  
They strung her upon  
A willow across the way  
  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her lovely head and cried  
Madam...  
Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today



Dark is the light,  
The man you fight,  
With all your prayers, incantations,  
Running away, a trivial day,  
Of judgment and deliverance,  
To whom was sold, this bounty soul,  
A gentile or a priest ?  
Who victored over, the seljuks,  
When the holy land was taken  
  
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens  
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens  
  
Was it the riches, of the land,  
Powers of bright darkness,  
That lead the noble, to the east,  
To fight the heathens  
  
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens  
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens  
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens  
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens  
  
We must call upon our bright darkness,  
Beliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked,  
One was written on the sword,  
For you must enter a room to destroy it,  
International security,  
Call of the righteous man,  
Needs a reason to kill man,  
History teaches us so,  
The reason he must attain,  
Must be approved by his god,  
His child, partisan brother of war,  
  
Of war, we don't speak anymore,  
Of war, we don't speak anymore,  
Of war, we don't speak anymore,  
Of war, we don't speak anymore,  
  
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens  
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens  
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens  
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens



Whenever I'm alone with you  
You make me feel like I am home again  
Whenever I'm alone with you  
You make me feel like I am whole again  
  
Whenever I'm alone with you  
You make me feel like I am young again  
Whenever I'm alone with you  
You make me feel like I am fun again  
  
However far away I will always love you  
However long I stay I will always love you  
Whatever words I say I will always love you  
I will always love you  
  
Whenever I'm alone with you  
You make me feel like I am free again  
Whenever I'm alone with you  
You make me feel like I am clean again  
  
However far away I will always love you  
However long I stay I will always love you  
Whatever words I say I will always love you  
I will always love you  
  
However far away I will always love you  
However long I stay I will always love you  
Whatever words I say I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
'Cause I love you



What were you thinking?  
I guess I'll never know  
See your eyes blinking, pupils begin to grow  
Killing you softly  
Pulling you in  
Making your mind up of whats sick or a sin  
  
Open up now  
Let it all go  
I'm quite certain  
Say it ain't so  
You're corrupted by some sick fuck  
Oh no  
Open up now  
Head in the sky  
Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies,  
Still, it's in my mouth,  
You breathe in but can't breathe out.  
  
What you been taking  
It makes you talk real slow  
How come I'm thinking you'd be the last to know (you'd be the last to know)  
  
Choking you gently  
Gaining control  
Hand you the shovel  
To dig your own hole  
  
Open up now  
Let it all go  
I'm quite certain  
Say it ain't so  
You're corrupted by some sick fuck  
Oh no  
Open up now  
Head in the sky  
Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies,  
Still, it's in my mouth,  
You breathe in but can't breathe out.  
  
Choking you gently  
Gaining control  
Hand you the shovel  
To dig your own hole  
  
Open up now  
Let it all go  
Open up now  
Let it all go  
Open up now  
Head in the sky  
Pierce the tongue that keeps telling lies,  
Still, it's in my mouth,  
You breathe in but can't breathe out.



I tried to tie you to the bed saliva at my lips  
I made it look so comfortable but could not feel to grip  
Your eyelids flickered with surprise as suddenly you saw  
Your hands and feet all bound and gagged and me out on the floor  
It gets harder and hard so hard  
It gets harder and hard so hard  
It gets harder and hard so hard  
It gets so hard  
  
I tried to dance around the room in ballerina tights  
With music from the Valkyries and dimmers on my lights  
You tapped your feet and said that I should take another twirl  
You said that I would be so good if I was just a girl  
  
I try to touch you with a song arouse you with some grapes  
Enchant you with some lavender but this was my mistake  
'Cause you prefer to move around to play at postman's knock  
I'd like to see your sails go up the face smile on your clock



You left you didn't say goodbye  
You never gave me a reason why  
My tears are dried now it's been a while  
Now there you szand you're back again  
Do you think that time stands still do you think that time stands still  
Things have changed I've rearranged so many things  
Do you think that time stands still do you think that time stands still  
It never has it never will do you think that time stands still  
You won't to start where we left off  
Somebody found the love you lost  
Love has its price we've paid the cost  
We lose and learn now it's your turn  
Do you think that time stands still...  
Do you think that time stands still...  
Oh do you think that time stands still...  
  
  



When you hear that rooster crowing  
In the dawn, in the dawn  
There's really no way of knowing  
What goes on, what goes on  
  
The world is full of questions  
Some are answered, some are not  
The only faith you're keepin'  
Is the faith that you still got  
  
I love the sound of laughter  
And music in the air  
And in the ever after  
I know it's always there  
  
A man had many boxes  
And he liked them quite a lot  
But they would not be opened  
Cause the value would be shot  
  
Sometimes when I go walkin'  
In the trees, in the trees  
That's where I do my prayin'  
In the trees, in the trees  
  
The world is full of answers  
Some are right, some are wrong  
The one that I believe in is a wish in a song  
  
I love to see you smilin'  
And hear your voice so fair  
And in the ever after  
I know you're always there



At times it seems too rough, things just drag me down  
It's hard to find the strength to just one more round  
When I need help, I know where to go  
'cause you're the best friend that I could ever know  
Being taught the words from you .... from what is true  
Someone to share the pain that I'm going through  
And it's a heavy load that I bear and it's a heavy crown that I wear  
As I travel down this road, it's a heavy load, it's a heavy load  
  
It's a heavy load that I bear and it's a heavy crown that I wear  
So help me one more time, it's such an uphill climb  
As I travel down this road, it's a heavy load  
Lord it's a heavy load, Lord it's a heavy load, Lord it's a heavy load  
Lord it's a heavy load, Lord it's a heavy load....  
  



Baby tell me what you're trying to prove  
Playing games with my heart  
Hey now listen, I ain't gonna take one more night  
You're the one who broke the rules  
And I'm the one who played the fool  
Now you're trying to tell me it's alright  
You should know better than to hurt a friend  
You'll never get another chance again  
  
You'll be back where you started  
I know you won't admit it but you're broken-hearted  
Back where you started  
You think it's gonna be easy but it just gets harder, harder  
  
You had a way with words  
One look and I was under your spell  
I didn't know should I stay or should I run  
You can't deny you told me lies  
Love 'em and leave 'em baby, that's your style  
I'm not afraid to take life as it comes  
You play with fire I guess you'll never learn  
You mess with me babe, you 're gonna get burned  
  
You'll be back where you started  
I know how it feels when you've been discarded  
Back where you started  
You think you got it made but it won't get you far, no it won't get you far  
  
Who's gonna help ya, throw you a lifetime  
I'll tell you one thing, you've really done it this time  
You took your one chance and let it slip away



He's given hope through the ages  
Give sight to the blind  
Brought understanding to sages  
And peace to troubled minds  
To humble hearts, who will call His name  
To all who will believe  
[Chorus:]  
He's watching with angels, He's ready to fly  
One word, just a whisper, He's there  
Knock and He'll open, seek and you'll find  
Call on His name, He's the answer  
Waiting for a prayer  
He'll give you faith like a fire  
To keep your feet on the path  
And if it's mercy you require  
He'll be the touch of Healing Hands  
To humble hearts, who will call His name  
To all who will believe  
[Chorus:]  
Fall on your knees and believe  
The Father hears you when you pray  
Anytime, night or day  
And He will say  
[Chorus:]  
I'm watching with angels, I'm ready to fly  
One word, just a whisper, I'll be there  
Knock and He'll open, seek and you'll find  
Call on His name, He's the answer  
Waiting for a prayer



Massacred, hacked to death, my revenge  
Slicing deep, into your flesh, the pain intense  
Dreams of hate, misery, fill my mind  
Puke in your face in disgust, it's time to die  
  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
  
Staring your severed head in the face  
I celebrate a faggot's death, human disgrace  
Hanging your mangled corpse for display  
My revenge was fulfilled upon this day  
  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
You must die in pain  
  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation  
Mutilation



We have come from the ashes of the burning away  
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain  
Led into temptation, now the black gods align  
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.  
  
Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead  
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed  
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie  
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.  
  
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,  
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,  
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies  
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.



Where's this come from? he's just as  
Where's this come from  
He's just as dumb  
As he denies  
  
He never lies  
Her new disguise  
Is butterflies  
  
I'm all sick for you  
I'm not a fool  
You're the one that bothers me  
I am not a fool  
You're the one pretending to be  
  
I die for some  
Rare pelicans  
In wonderland  
  
If she was true  
She'd make them blue  
Everytime (yeah it goes)  
  
Where's this come from  
He's just as dumb  
As he denies



Well sometimes I go out by myself  
And I look across the water  
And I think of all the things what you're doing  
And in my head I paint a picture  
  
'Cause since I've come on home  
Well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
And the way you like to dress  
  
Won't you come on over  
Stop makin? A fool out of me  
Why don't you come on over valerie?  
Valerie valerie valerie  
  
Did you have to go to jail  
Put your house on up for sale  
Did you get a good lawyer?  
  
Hope you didn't catch a tan  
Hope you find the right man  
Who'll fix it for you  
Are you shopping anywhere  
Changed the color of your hair  
Are you busy?  
  
And did you have to pay that fine  
You was dodging all the time  
Are you still busy?  
  
Since I've come on home  
Well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
And the way you like to dress  
  
Won't you come on over  
Stop makin? A fool out of me  
Why don't you come on over valerie?  
Valerie valerie valerie  
  
Well sometimes I go out by myself  
And I look across the water  
And I think of all the things what you're doing  
And in my head I paint a picture

Well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
And the way you like to dress  
  
Won't you come on over  
Stop makin? A fool out of me  
Why don't you come on over valerie?  
Valerie valerie valerie  
  
Valerie valerie valerie valerie  
Why don't you come on over valerie?



Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,  
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,  
Never bein' able to separate the good from the bad,  
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,  
It's makin' me feel so bad.  
  
Dead man, dead man,  
When will you rise?  
Cobwebs in your mind,  
Dust in your eyes.  
  
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.  
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?  
The way that you hold your head, cursin' God with every move,  
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,  
What are you tryin' to prove?  
  
Dead man, dead man,  
When will you rise?  
Cobwebs in your mind,  
Dust in your eyes.  
  
The glamor ad the bright lights and the politics of sin,  
The ghetto you build for me is the one you end up in,  
The race of the engine that overrules your heart,  
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,  
Pretending that you're so smart.  
  
Dead man, dead man,  
When will you rise?  
Cobwebs in your mind,  
Dust in your eyes.  
  
What are you tryin' to overpower me with, the doctrine or the gun?  
My back is already to the wall, where can I run?  
The tuxedo that you're wearin', the flower in your lapel,  
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,  
You want to take me down to hell.  
  
Dead man, dead man,  
When will you rise?  
Cobwebs in your mind,  
Dust in your eyes.



Everybody knows all the highs and all the lows,  
And in that nothing ever goes right,  
It's not up to me if you look but you don't see,  
What could obviously be alright?  
  
Like goin' nowhere,like goin' nowhere baby  
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere  
  
It's a vision,not religion,  
And the truth is plain to see,  
It's a feeling,it's revealing,  
Nowhere you can hide,  
So don't blame me.  
  
There's no guarantee what you get is what you see,  
Don't try to find it,just don't try,  
Don't try living in the past,if you want your dreams to last,  
Don't hide behind the mask of lies,  
  
Like goin' nowhere,like goin' nowhere baby,  
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere  
  
It's a vision,not religion,  
And the truth is plain to see,  
It's a feeling,it's revealing,  
So don't blame me [Repeat x4]  
  
Deep inside of me,lives a hunger to be free,  
I know I'll have to pay the prize,  
I may never know when it comes or when it goes,  
I guess it's just a part of life?  
  
Like goin' nowhere,like goin' nowhere baby,  
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere,  
  
It's a vision,it's religion,  
And the truth is plain to see,  
It's a feeling,it's revealing,  
Nowhere you can hide,  
So don't blame me [Repeat x4]



You'd never know there was some music playin'  
Until you talked your way inside the door  
And then a sound like rollin' thunder  
Begins to push you right thru the floor  
  
And there's a great white sign  
With big black letters  
That just about explains it all  
  
If you don't like rock 'n' roll  
Well, if you don't like rock 'n' roll  
If you don't like rock 'n' roll  
Then it's too late now  
Well it's too late now  
  
Hey hey  
Of course there was the usual lady  
And she was dressed the way the stories tell  
So bein' cool I made a move to grab her  
But you could see she read story well  
  
And then she whipped out a card  
With big black letters  
That just about explained it all  
  
Well if you don't like rock 'n' roll  
If you don't like rock 'n' roll  
Well if you don't like rock 'n' roll  
Then you're too late now  
Then you're too late now  
  
Well, if you don't like rock 'n' roll  
Well, if you don't like rock 'n' roll, yeah  
If you don't like rock 'n' roll  
Well it's too late now  
Well you're too late now  
  
If you don't like rock 'n' roll  
If you don't like my rock 'n' roll  
Then you're too late now  
Then you're too late now  
Then you're too late, too late now

You tell lies thinking I can't see  
You don't cry 'cause you're laughing at me  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
I'm down (down on the ground)  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down  
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down  
  
Man buys ring woman throws it away  
Same old thing happen everyday  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
I'm down (down on the ground)  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down  
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down  
  
We're all alone and there's nobody else  
You still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself!"  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
I'm down (down on the ground)  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down  
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down  
  
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)  
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)  
Down on the ground (I'm really down)  
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)  
Down, down, down



[Verse 1]  
There are moments that the words don't reach  
There is suffering too terrible to name  
You hold your child as tight as you can  
Then push away the unimaginable  
The moments when you're in so deep  
Feels easier to just swim down  
And so they move uptown  
And learn to live with the unimaginable  
  
I spend hours in the garden  
I walk alone to the store  
And it's quiet uptown  
I never liked the quiet before  
I take the children to church on Sunday  
A sign of the cross at the door  
And I pray  
That never used to happen before  
  
[Chorus]  
If you see him in the street walking by himself  
Talking to himself, have pity  
You would like it uptown, it's quiet uptown  
He is working through the unimaginable  
His hair has gone grey, he passes every day  
They say he walks the length of the city  
You knock me out, I fall apart  
Can you imagine?  
  
[Verse 2]  
Look at where we are  
Look at where we started  
I know I don't deserve you  
But hear me out, that would be enough  
If I could spare his life  
If I could trade his life for mine  
He'd be standing here right now  
And you would smile  
And that would be enough  
I don't pretend to know  
The challenges we're facing  
I know there's no replacing what we've lost  
And you need time  
But I'm not afraid  
I know who I married  
Just let me stay here by your side  
And that would be enough  
  
[Chorus]  
If you see him in the street, walking by her side  
Talking by her side, have pity  
Do you like it uptown? It's quiet uptown  
He is trying to do the unimaginable  
If you see him walking in the park, long after dark  
Taking in the sights of the city  
Look around, look around, look around  
They are trying to do the unimaginable  
  
[Verse 3]  
There are moments that the words don't reach  
There's a grace too powerful to name  
We push away what we could never understand  
We push away the unimaginable  
They are standing in the garden  
Standing there side by side  
She takes his hand  
It's quiet uptown  
Forgiveness, can you imagine?  
Forgiveness, can you imagine?  
  
[Chorus]  
If you see him in the street, walking by her side  
Talking by her side, have pity  
Look around, look around  
They are going through the unimaginable



Hush little darling, don't you cry.  
Daddy's coming home, coming home tonight.  
No bed of roses for your head, for you.  
You see no future, it's all in the past.  
This is a nightmare, won't be your last.  
It's hard to admit, it's hard to admit you're that blind.  
  
Mommy and daddy don't see eye to eye.  
Mommy and daddy don't see when we cry.  
Mommy and daddy they don't understand.  
What's wrong with this picture, is right in their hands.  
  
Sleeping with an angel. ah  
Woke up with a monster. ah  
Sleeping with an angel. ah  
Woke up with a monster. ah  
  
Hush little darling, don't be long.  
Momma's little angel can't do nothing wrong.  
No bed of roses in your head, for you.  
Who'll dry your tear when you cry?  
Daddy's comin' home just in time.  
Will, he be the one to make it, to help make it right?  
  
Mommy and daddy don't see eye to eye.  
Mommy and daddy make each other cry.  
  
Sleeping with an angel. ah  
Woke up with a monster. ah  
Sleeping with an angel. ah  
Woke up with a monster. ah  
  
Not sleeping with an angel. ah  
Not sleeping with an angel. ah  
Mommy and daddy don't see eye to eye.  
Mommy and daddy don't hear when we cry.  
  
Mommy and daddy don't see eye to eye.  
Mommy and daddy don't see when we cry.  
Mommy and daddy they don't understand.  
What's wrong with this picture, is right in their hands.  
  
Sleeping with an angel. ah  
Woke up with a monster. ah  
Sleeping with an angel. ah  
Woke up with a monster. ah  
  
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
No! no! no! no! no! no! no! no! no.  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ow.



Oh no no  
oh no no  
  
Verse 1:  
Sometimes I wish I knew your name  
At times I want to say hello  
But you seem so far away  
To let my feelings show  
And though I don't know what to say  
I feel that someday soon one day  
Love will place you by my side  
And it shall be our guide  
  
Chorus:  
And then manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long to be with you  
Oh manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long for you  
  
Verse 2:  
When I have you by my side  
You will always be my pride  
Love so simple yet so sweet  
I do think you're all I need  
So I thought I'd let you know  
That my heart forever grows  
Closer to your warm embrace  
Everytime I see your face  
  
Chorus:  
And then manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long to be with you  
Oh manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long for you  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And so manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long to be with you  
Oh manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long for you  
  
Bridge:  
Do you know I don't know you  
I want to show you I do love you  
That I do do, do love you  
Oh babe, I think about you  
Even though I don't know you  
I want to show you I do love you  
And that I do do, I think about you  
Oh babe, I do love you  
Even though I don't know you  
I want to show you I do love you  
I think about you  
Oh do do, oh do do, oh do do  
  
Chorus (x2)



Hey, got my hands in my back pocket  
I'm a jumpin'  
Unscrewing the light from the socket  
And I'd rather stand than sit  
Puttin' all the people in the dark  
Tellin' everyone good night bye bye  
I put the sound  
  
Carryin' the truth in my back pocket  
My hands are holdin' me down  
I've been waiting for people to ask me  
What have you found  
  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I was dead before a gypsy  
She held my head and  
Fought with my boots till my eyes turned red  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
Oh I'd rather stand than sit  
I've been down to the gutter  
Hopin' I've lived on honey and butter  
But with me a life's a game  
I call insane  
I'm not the one to blame  
I'm called insane  
  
I was hung when I was young  
I was named insane  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I broke all the laws before my age  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
Yeah I'd rather stand than sit  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I turn around to see the clown  
But with me a life's a game  
I call insane  
I'm not the one to blame  
I'm called insane  
  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I'd rather stand than sit  
I'm a jumpin' humpin' hip hypocrit  
I'd rather stand than sit  
I put the sound



I don't care what anybody thinks of me  
My pride is gone and here I am on bended knees  
I want you and I need you that's all I know  
And I'd fight the world before I'd ever let go go  
I'd gladly beg I'd steal I'd borrow I'd turn my back on everyone I know  
I'd do these things with no fear of tomorrow  
I'd fight the world before I'd ever let go go  
[ vibes ]  
I'd gladly beg I'd steal I'd borrow...

Come, let's talk just you and me  
For once just let me be.  
The little boy you used to know.  
Relive that summer's bliss.  
Cause they came no more like this.  
Those were the days,  
The days when love was still in style.  
  
[Chorus]  
All I ever dreamed I'd be  
Is what you are to me.  
Bigger than Elvis.  
And for all the missing years,  
A memory reappears.  
Bigger than Elvis.  
  
I saw you on TV.  
The king, you were to me.  
Could you feel me watching you?  
At times my heart got mad,  
Only heroes are allowed  
To run free, that they could come back inside of me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We know the sadness of goodbyes  
Must be the one that's bringing tears to your child's eyes.  
  
Oh, from now on I'll walk with you  
Making music like you do.  
Would you believe I always knew?  
  
You were never hard to take  
In some mysterious way  
Bigger than Elvis  
And for all the missing years  
Your memory reappears  
Bigger than Elvis.  
  
Now I've found the missing years,  
Forgotten all my tears.  
I've found the missing years.

All we need, yeah!



I'm an autumn girl, flying over london  
With the trees on fire it looks like home  
I'm an autumn girl on the endless search for summer  
Cause I need some love to cook my frozen bones  
You needed something to get your teeth into  
And in my voodoo kitchen you said  
"I've got something to show you,  
It's a recipe handed down from father to son  
For a thousand years, and it goes with those hot salt tears."  
I'm an autumn girl, crying over london  
With a heart on fire but no-one home  
I'm an autumn girl on the endless search for summer  
Cause I need some love to heat my frozen bones  
Get me on the boil and reduce me  
To a simmering wreck with a slow kiss  
To the back of my neck  
Carve up my heart on a very low flame  
Separate my feelings then pour them down the drain  
Close my eyes and sweeten me with lies  
Pierce my skin with a few well chosen words  
Now you can stuff me with whatever you've got handy  
And on a cold grey day a cold grey man will do  
I'm an autumn girl, flying over london  
With the trees on fire it looks like home  
I'm an autumn girl on the endless search for summer  
Cause I need some love to heat my frozen bones  
So give me something to whet my appetite  
And chill my soul with a sudden lack of interest  
Oh, but the winter freezes on and the candle's burned low  
Fill me with the hot stuff then say you've got to go  
Take my mind, marinade it in red wine  
Grate my thighs with your chinny chin chin  
And I will let you in  
Oh on a long dark night a long dark man might ...  



I don't have plans and schemes and I don't have hopes and dreams.  
I don't have anything since I don't have you.  
I don't have fond desires and I don't have happy hours.  
I don't have anything since I don't have you.  
I don't have happiness and I guess I never will again.  
When you walked out on me in came old misery,  
And he's been here since then.  
I don't have love to share and I don't have one who cares.  
I don't have anything since I don't have you.  
You, you...



You called me up on the phone today  
Struggling with the right words to say.  
Time can change a thing or two.  
Time has changed the lives of me and you,  
But you know it could have been different dad.  
  
The word brings back a sweet memory.  
I'm sitting on a bluff on a broken tree,  
By my side a distinguished man  
Giving me encouragement, telling me I can,  
And you know you're not there.  
  
You say, "Son, let's forget the past,  
I want another chance, gonna make it last."  
You're begging me for a brand new start,  
Trying to mend a bridge that's been blown apart,  
But you know you never built it dad.  
  
So I sit here through the night,  
And I write myself to sleep,  
And time keeps ticking  
  
Time has made you finally realize  
Your loneliness and your guilt inside.  
You're reaching for something you never had,  
Turning around now you're looking back,  
And you know I'm not there.  
  
You say, "Son, let's forget the past.  
I want another chance, gonna make it last."  
You're begging me for a brand new start,  
Trying to mend a bridge that's been blown apart,  
But you know you never built it dad.



Well, I hear mariachi static on my radio  
And the tubes they glow in the dark  
And I'm there with her in Ensenada  
And I'm here in Echo Park  
  
Carmelita, hold me tighter  
I think I'm sinking down...  
And I'm all strung out on heroin  
On the outskirts of town  
  
Well I'm sittin' here playing solitaire  
With my pearl handled deck  
The county won't give me no more methadone  
And they cut off your welfare check  
  
Carmelita, hold me tighter  
I think I'm sinking down...  
And I'm all strung out on heroin  
On the outskirts of town  
  
Well I pawned my Smith Corona  
And I went to meet my man  
He hangs out down on Alvarado Street  
At the Pioneer Chicken stand  
  
Carmelita, hold me tighter  
I think I'm sinking down  
And I'm all strung out on heroin  
On the outskirts of town  
  
Carmelita, hold me tighter  
I think I'm sinking down  
And I'm all strung out on heroin  
On the outskirts of town



[Verse 1]  
Alright, so this is really fucked up, but  
Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude  
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe
and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again  
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I
guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of
love with him in the first place  
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong
that, I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to
be  
And you know that, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence,
but you know, I haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea
what the fuck I want, I guess  
  
[Chorus 1]  
You're giving me a feeling in my head  
Laying in my bed just thinking  
Not really feeling like the one I want  
Takes everything in me not to call him  
I really, really, really want it, too  
I told all my friends I'm moving on  
Your baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
  
[Verse 2]  
You know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit
and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue
down my fucking throat  
I mean, even in front of your mom  
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough  
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass
bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch  
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your
fucking friends do  
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead
but, you know I just, I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo  
  
[Chorus 2]  
You keep saying again and again  
We're laying in my bed just talking  
And now I, now I can't hold it back  
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit  
I don't really want to let go of you  
I heard I change my mind with you often  
Baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
  
[Verse 3]  
Alright, so, I'm gonna be honest  
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here  
I mean, I'm fucking what?  
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send
back the monkey, you know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes? That
means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me  
I mean, I don't wanna say it person, I just bury my head in your armpit
which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth  
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do  
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...  
Well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world  
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to
someone giving a fuck  
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit  
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter
what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo  
  
[Chorus 3]  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking  
I don't really want [?] you  
I heard I change my mind with you often  
Baby talk is creeping me out  
Fuck me so you stop baby talking



Please stay  
Please stay  
Two words I've thought I'd never learn to say  
Don't go away  
Please stay  
  
Don't leave me here  
When so many things so hard to see are clear  
I need you near to me  
  
Will you stay with me to the end?  
When there's nothing left  
But you and me and the wind  
We'll never know till we try  
To find the other side of goodbye  
  
Please stay  
Please slay  
Two words I've thought I'd never learn to say  
Don't go away  
Please stay



Maybe one day I'll be an honest man  
Up till now I'm doing the best I can  
Long roads, long days, of sunrise, to sunset  
Sunrise to sunset  
  
Dream on brothers, while you can  
Dream on sister, I hope you find the one  
All of our lives, covered up quickly  
By the tides of time  
  
Spend your days full of emptiness  
Spend your years full of loneliness  
Wasting love, in a desperate caress  
Rolling shadows of night  
  
Dream on brothers, while you can  
Dream on sisters, I hope you find the one  
All of our lives, covered up quickly  
By the tides of time  
  
Sands are flowing and the lines  
Are in your hand  
In your eyes I see the hunger, and the  
Desperate cry that tears the night



I'm sailing away set an open course for the virgin sea  
I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me  
On board I'm the captain so climb aboard  
We'll search for tomorrow on every shore  
And I'll try oh Lord I'll try to carry on  
  
I look to the sea reflections in the waves spark my memory  
Some happy some sad  
I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had  
We live happily forever so the story goes  
But somehow we missed out on that pot of gold  
But we'll try best that we can to carry on  
  
A gathering of angels appeared above my head  
They sang to me this song of hope and this is what they said  
They said come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me  
Come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me  
  
I thought that they were angels but to my surprise  
They climbed aboard their starship and headed for the skies  
Singing come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me  
Come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me



I conjure up the thought of being gone  
But I'd probably even do that wrong  
I try to think about which way  
Would I be able to and would I be afraid  
  
Cause oh I'm bleeding out inside  
Oh I don't even mind (Yeah)  
  
It's all your fault  
You called me beautiful  
You turned me out  
And now I can't turn back  
I hold my breath  
Because you were perfect  
But I'm running out of air  
And it's not fair  
  
Da da dada da dada da  
Da dadadadadada da dadadadadada  
  
I'm trying to figure out what else to say (What else could I say)  
To make you turn around and come back this way (Would you just come back this
way)  
I feel like we could be really awesome together  
So make up your mind cause it's now or never (oh)  
  
It's all your fault  
You called me beautiful  
You turned me out  
And now I can't turn back  
I hold my breath  
Because you were perfect  
But I'm running out of air  
And it's not fair  
  
I would never pull the trigger  
But I've cried wolf a thousand times  
I wish you could  
Feel as bad as I do  
I have lost my mind  
  
It's all your fault  
You called me beautiful  
You turned me out  
And now I can't turn back  
I hold (I hold) my breath (My breath)  
Because you were perfect  
But I'm running out of air (running out of air)  
And it's not fair  
  
(Oh yeah  
It's all your fault)  
  
I hold my breath  
Because you were perfect  
But I'm running out of air  
And it's not (It's not) fair



If it gets you down well then I'll take it  
If it gets you up well I don't want it  
It let you down so broken-hearted  
If it gets you down well then I want it  
  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
We're nothing at all  
  
So blow our mind and make it lazy  
Those long, long days with no escaping  
I hold the wheel to let it go  
Don't want to stop, don't want to know  
If it gets you down, well just don't blame me  
  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
If only, only  
We're nothing at all



Dare To Believe  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
You're standing at a mountain  
That you know you cannot climb  
Your enemys approaching  
You hear him coming from behind  
There is trouble all around you  
There's no place to run away  
But there's a voice  
That's deep inside you  
Saying it's time to stand in faith  
Chorus:  
I dare to believe  
That miracles happen,  
That mountains still move,  
And demons must flee  
For the God that we serve  
He is much more than able  
So don't be afraid  
Stand up and say,  
I dare to believe  
There's a miracle inside you  
It's just a mustard seed of faith  
But by the mighty hand of God now  
You know that tiny seed was placed  
And though this world  
May try to crush you  
It can never keep you down  
Soon the life of God inside you  
Will come breaking through the ground  
Chorus  
No matter what the doubters tell you  
No matter what the devil says  
No matter what anybody,  
Anybody else does  
You just keep trusting Jesus  
You'll see and won't be long  
God is right and the doubters are wrong  
Just say,  
Chorus 2X  
No don't be afraid  
Just stand up and say,  
I dare to believe  
No don't be afraid  
Just stand up and say,  
I dare to believe

I had it with the same old routine  
I had it with the same old faces, places  
Every night, in my life  
I started feeling washed up, washed out  
Hung up, wrung out, left to dry out  
Every night  
But I know  
Yeah, I know you're out there, somewhere  
Oh, I, I can almost hear you callin'  
I'm looking for a stranger in the night  
I need a little danger in my life, tonight  
  
I'm tired of the same old  
"Hello baby, how ya doin'? Come here often?"  
Where have you been all my life?"  
Every night  
  
But I know  
That someday, somewhere  
I'll turn around and you'll be there  
Ooh...In my life  
Every night  
  
But I know  
Yeah, I know you're out there, somewhere  
Oh, I, I can almost hear you callin'  
I'm looking for a stranger in the night  
I need a little danger in my life, tonight  
  
I'm looking for a stranger in the night  
I need a little danger in my life, tonight



I led a lonesome journey  
Full of disdain and fury  
I kept my angered yearning  
Close to me like fire burning  
I watched a million chances  
Slip through my weathered hands  
I almost lost myself when I looked around  
There was nobody else  
[Chorus:]  
In the nick of time  
You opened up my mind  
And suddenly I saw the world much clearer  
In the nick of time  
You turned my water to wine  
And suddenly I didn't feel the fear  
Right before my eyes  
You showed me there was life that to be found  
You're the miracle I prayed about you  
You were the one to save my life  
In the nick of time  
I followed habits around  
Been swept above off the clouds  
But fallen down left shaken  
Abandened by the pills I'd taken  
I could have kept on going  
With no one ever knowing  
Who really wants to see a tired nobody like me  
[Chorus (2x)]  
I could not, I could not believe  
That you were right there waiting  
I never, no, I never dreamed  
That you'd be right there waiting  
Oh you were there for me  
And when I couldn't see,  
I couldn't, no, I couldn't see  
You showed me life [2x]  
LIFE [3x]  
[Chorus (2x)]  



You are the best, for all of times  
You beat the rest, you're in my mind  
Don't take away, this dream in me  
Don't leave me here in misery  
You are the best, from coast to coast  
From east to west, love you the most  
It's hard to win, you try your best  
And we are sure, you'll beat the rest  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Ten seconds to countdown  
Ten seconds to know  
Who will be the hero  
Everybody loves the show  
  
You are the champ, a hurricane  
From heaven sent, you win again  
Oh tell me where, the hero's gone  
But you are here, we can't go wrong  
The price is high, when dreams come true  
Oh we can fly, it's up to you  
It's hard to win, you try your best  
And we are sure, you beat the rest  
  
[Chorus: ]



Just like the driftwood of a dream  
Left on the seashore of sleep  
Just like the words that wouldn't rhyme  
Lost in the desert of time  
Time waits for no one at all  
No, not even you  
You thought you'd seen it all before  
You really thought you knew  
I don't remember what was said  
In the confusion that night  
I only know what's on my mind  
What's in the future, we will decide  
Time waits for no one at all  
No, not even you  
You thought you'd seen it all before  
You really thought you knew  
I've shattered the illusion of fortune and of fame  
But darling, now I know you  
Life could never be the same  
Oh no, don't leave me driftwood on the shore  
Time waits for no one my love  
No, not even you  
You thought you'd seen it all before  
You really thought you knew  
I've shattered the illusion of fortune and of fame  
I'm waking up, I'm reaching up  
I'm getting up from this game  
Oh no, don't leave me driftwood on the shore  
Oh no, don't, don't leave me driftwood on the shore  
Oh no, don't, don't leave me driftwood on the shore  



Thorn in my side.  
You know that's all you ever were.  
A bundle of lies.  
You know that's all that it was worth  
I should have known better  
But I trusted you at first.  
I should have known better  
But I got what I deserved  
  
To run away from you  
Was all that I could do.  
To run away from you  
Was all that I could do.  
  
Thorn in my side.  
You know that's all you'll ever be.  
So don't think you know better  
'Cause that's what you mean to me  
I was feeling complicated.  
I was feeling low.  
Now everytime I think of you  
I shiver to the bone  
  
[Chorus]



Heart-breaker soul-shaker I've been told about you  
Steam-roller the midnight shoulder  
What they been sayin' must be true  
  
Red hot mama oh that charmer  
Time's come to pay your dues  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch  
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch  
Now you're messin' with a a son of a bitch  
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch  
  
Talking jive and poison ivy  
You ain't gonna cling to me  
Minute-taker fall-faker  
I ain't so blind I can't see  
  
Red hot mama oh that charmer  
Time's come to pay your dues  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Chorus: repeat 4x]



We all live on the edge of town  
Where we all live ain't a soul around  
People start a-comin'  
All we do is just a-grin  
Said we gotta move out  
'Cause the city's movin' in  
I said we gotta move out  
'Cause the city's movin' in  
  
Tell me who you know  
And I'll tell you who, too  
Go see my friend and he'll set you free  
Tell me what you see and  
Maybe I can go too  
No one knows the way but maybe me  
  
Nobody goes there  
Nobody shows where  
Nobody knows where you can find me, yeah  
  
Good mornin' glory, hallelujah to you  
What is the story, what's been goin' through ya  
Livin' like a king of the fat of the land  
Workin' like a dog in a rock n' roll band  
  
Movin', we're gettin' out  
Movin', without a doubt  
Movin', we're goin' far  
We're movin', oh yes we are  
  
Nobody goes there  
Nobody shows where  
Nobody goes where you can find me  
Nobody knows there  
Nobody shows where  
Nobody goes where you can find me, ah  
Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy...  
  
Level with God  
And you're in tune with the universe  
Talk with yourself  
And you'll hear what you wanna know  
Gotta rise above  
'Cause below it's only gettin' worse  
Life in time  
Will take you where you wanna go  
  
Where you wanna go, where you wanna go  
Where you goin'...  
  
Good mornin' glory, hallelujah to you  
What is the story, what's been goin' through ya  
Livin' like a king of the fat of the land  
Workin' like a dog in a rock n' roll band  
  
Movin', we're gettin' out  
Movin', yeah, without a doubt  
Movin', we're goin' far  
We're movin', oh yes we are  
  
Nobody knows there  
Nobody shows where  
Nobody goes where you can find me  
Nobody knows there  
Nobody shows where  
Nobody goes where you can't find me  
Round n' round...  
  
We all live on the edge of town  
Where we all live ain't a soul around  
People start a-comin'  
All we do is just a-grin  
We gotta move out  
'Cause the city's movin' in  
I said we gotta move out  
'Cause the city's movin' in  
  
Yes we do...



When I come to the dock and sit very still,  
I wonder why on earth we fight and kill.  
I see a light on the other side flickering to me,  
As if to say, you're alright, you'll find your way.  
  
The world is so beautiful when I'm out here,  
Why can't it be the same when we're back there?  
  
Above my head, straight ahead,  
I see a bird gliding  
As if to say, I'm alright, I'll find my way.  
  
Windows are shattered,  
Streets are battered,  
Kids are frightened,  
Men are still at war.  
  
Moms are feeling sad,  
Dads are feeling bad.  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
If the world's gone mad.  
  
Above my head, straight ahead,  
I see a bird gliding  
As if to say, I'm alright, I'll find my way.



I got a blue bird  
A blue bird on my shoulder  
I got a blue bird  
A blue bird on my shoulder  
  
I saw her standing  
Standing by the water  
She was naked  
Her hair in great disorder  
  
And I know why I'm flying  
And the rest is lies  
  
I sent a warning  
A warning of disaster  
I sent a warning  
I warned of great disaster  
  
I sent that blue bird  
That blue bird down the water  
I sent that blue bird  
Floating down the water  
  
And I know that I'm flying  
And the rest is lies  
  
And I know that I'm flying  
And the rest is lies.



Sugar never tasted so good  
Sugar never tasted so good  
Sugar never tasted good to me  
Yeah  
  
Until her eyes crossed over  
Until her mind crossed over  
Until her soul fell next to me  
Yeah  
  
Now  
If the wrinkle that is in your brain  
Has given ya quite a sting  
Your fingers have become a crane  
Pullin' on these puppet strings  
  
What a feelin' that's begun  
What a feelin' that's begun  
  
What a feelin' that's begun  
What a feelin' that's begun  
  
I felt just like a baby  
Until I held a baby  
What a fool this boy can be  
Yeah  
  
And her thoughts like a daisy  
Till my mind gets lazy  
I must have been crazy not to see  
  
Now  
If the wrinkle that is in your brain  
Has given ya quite a sting  
Your fingers have become a crane  
Your fingers have become a crane  
Your fingers have become a crane  
Pullin' on these puppet strings  
  
Water never tasted so good  
Water never tasted so good  
Water never tasted good to me



How many times must I tell her  
How many times must I say  
I won't be around to pick her up again  
From now on she'll have to find her own way.  
  
How many years have I loved her  
While she stood by so unconcerned  
But the things she don't know I'll teach her when I go  
She's been wrong and I think it's time she learned.  
  
I think it's time she learned  
Love can't live when love is not returned  
She thought that I would always stand by  
But she's been wrong and I think it's time she learned.  
  
I think it's time she learned  
Love can't live when love is not returned  
She thought that I would always stand by  
But she's been wrong and I think it's time she learned.  
  
She's been wrong and I think it's time she learned



Memories light the corners of my mind  
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were  
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind  
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were  
  
Can it be that it was all so simple then  
Or has time rewritten every line  
If we had the chance to do it all again  
  
Tell me, would we?  
Could we?  
  
Memories may be beautiful and yet  
What's too painful to remember  
We simply choose to forget  
So it's the laughter we will remember  
Whenever we remember  
The way we were  
The way we were



They're always doin' fry  
Tryin' to get me high  
I felt the pressure but I never did  
  
They always call me dude  
Put it in my food  
I never wanted to when I was a kid  
  
I've got no septicals  
From eating egg rolls  
They took my squirt gun and made it a bong  
  
My teacher smelled my clothes  
They think I'm one of those  
My mom's from Utopia, my dad's Tommy Chong  
  
My sister's name  
Is Mary-Jane  
And mine's Bud, mine's Bud



To give is the reason I live  
To give all I can give  
In return, for the life that I earn  
  
I was born as a part of the plan  
With the heart of a man  
With a will to survive  
  
And I believe  
Everything on this earth  
Having meaning and worth  
Made of concrete and air  
Is to share and to feel  
Justify I exist  
To describe on the list  
Of someone  
With a place in the sun  
  
Here I stand, reaching out for the sky  
Till the day that I die  
I must give all I can  
When I go  
I'll go out empty hand  
Leaving dust to the land  
Just the soul I have found  
Leaves the ground



Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by  
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee  
Tonight.  
  
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above  
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of  
Wondering love  
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.  
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on  
Earth.  
  
Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by  
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee  
Tonight.



Let there be light, let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
Let's work together in harmony  
Let's build a better world, no suffering  
And in times of darkness, just reach out  
'Cause there is a promise, it won't be denied  
Let there be light, let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
Let there be light, let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
Let there be light, let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
Let there be light, let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
Let there be light, let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
Let there be light, let there be joy  
Let there be love and understanding  
Let there be peace throughout the land  
This is truly paradise  
Being here in this celestial garden  
With all the ones you love  
Where nothing dies or ever grows old  
And to be bathed in light  
That cast no shadow  
Yes, this is the kingdom within  
Still you know  
Sometimes I miss seeing and feeling  
The spirits dancing in the flesh  



Drivin' at night, you feel as if you're blind  
The sun is gone and it's stuck in your mind  
You look to the morning with expectation  
Anticipation  
  
When you feel the dark coming and you know that it's here  
You feel your spirit sing, you know there's nothing to fear  
I'm here by your side, I've got to no where to go  
So take your time, drive slow, listen to the radio  
Talk if you want, if don't just change the station  
I got patience  
  
I tell myself wait  
Wait till the sun goes down  
Wait and you'll come around  
And you'll smile for everyone  
I'll make you a place  
A place where the shadows fall  
Can be anyone or no one at all  
Just tell me what you want  
  
I know, sometimes you feel the need to beware  
I know that you scared that I care  
But I wonder who you're with when you turn out the lights  
Who do you think of at night  
  
When you feel the dark coming and you know that it's here  
I've been there before and you've got nothing to fear  
I'll make you a place where the shadows fall  
And you can be anyone or no one at all  
We'll take solace from the burning sun  
Let me be there for you just this once  
  
I tell myself wait  
Wait till the sun goes down  
Wait and you'll come around  
And you'll smile for everyone  
I'll make you a place  
A place where the shadows fall  
Can be anyone or no one at all  
Just tell me what you want



I came up the hard way  
And fought with my back to the wall  
Sometimes down to nothin'  
But right now, babe, we've got it all  
Looking back now  
When it comes down to facing the truth  
Ain't worth the powder  
To blow me to hell without you  
  
That's my Silver Eagle  
And my name up in lights  
And those big blue white diamonds  
They can't keep me warm late at night  
Here in the spotlight  
My dreams have come true  
But I ain't worth the powder  
To blow me to hell without you  
  
Well, you know if the time ever comes, babe  
When it's down to just win, lose or draw  
I don't Carewhat they take  
They can take what they want to  
As long as they leave you  
'cause you're the most precious thing of all  
  
Take my Silver Eagle  
And my name up in lights  
And those big blue diamonds  
They can't keep me warm late at night  
Here in the spotlight  
My dreams have come true  
But I ain't worth the powder  
To blow me to hell without you  
No I ain't worth the powder  
To blow me to hell without you

Come, Thou Fount of every blessing  
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace  
Streams of mercy, never ceasing  
Call for songs of loudest praise  
Teach me, ever to adore Thee  
May I still Thine goodness prove  
While the hope of endless glory  
Fills my heart with joy and love  
Oh, to Grace, how great a debtor  
Daily I'm constrained to be  
Let Thy goodness like a fetter  
Bind my wandering heart to Thee  
Never let me wander from Thee  
Never leave Thee, God I love  
Here's my heart, take and seal it  
Seal it for Thy courts above  
Never let me wander from Thee  
Never leave Thee, God I love  
Here's my heart, take and seal it  
Seal it for Thy courts above  



[Verse]  
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you  
You got something that belongs to me  
Your body language says it all  
Despite the things you said to me  
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?  
Changing your opinion on me  
I was only gone for the last few months  
But you don't have the time to wait on me  
  
[Hook]  
I try with you  
There's more to life than sleeping in  
And getting high with you  
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do  
And that just didn't sit right with you  
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose  
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose  
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah  
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it

Maybe we just should have did things my way  
Instead of the other way

Sweet Leilani  
Heavenly flower  
Nature fashioned roses kissed with dew  
And then she placed them in a bower  
  
It was the start of you  
Sweet Leilani  
Heavenly flower  
I dreamed of paradise for two  
  
You are my paradise completed  
You are my dream come true  
  
Sweet Leilani  
Heavenly flower  
Tropic skies are jealous as they shine  
I think they're jealous of your blue eyes  
  
Jealous because you're mine  
Sweet Leilani  
Heavenly flower  
I dreamed of paradise for two  
  
You are my paradise completed  
You are my dream come true  
  
You are my paradise completed  
You are my dream come true



Is it the voice of the whispering sea?  
Or is it the way we're dancing?  
Is it the way that the moon  
Hits your eyes?  
Or is this magic?  
Or is this magic?  
Is it the way that you sway  
In my arms?  
Or is it the soft winds blowing?  
Is it the music that carries us off?  
Or is this magic?  
Or is this magic?  
Close your eyes and drink in  
The sweet sad guitar  
Close your eyes and drift to  
The beat of the moon and the stars  
Is it the rush of the surf  
That I hear?  
Or only our mad hearts beating?  
Will this be only a fleeting affair?  
Or is this magic?  
Or is this magic?  
Close your eyes and drink in  
The sweet sad guitar  
Close your eyes and drift to  
The beat of the moon and the stars  
Is it the voice of the whispering sea?  
Or is it the way we're dancing?  
Will this be only a fleeting affair?  
Or is this magic?...



You made a fool of me,  
But them broken dreams have got to end.  
  
Hey, woman, you got the blues,  
'Cause you ain't got no one else to use.  
There's an open road that leads nowhere,  
So just make some miles between here and there.  
There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in.  
You took my body and played to win.  
Ha, ha, woman, it's a cryin' shame,  
But you ain't got nobody else to blame.  
  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
  
Rolled in from another town,  
Hit some gold, too hard to settle down.  
But a fool and his money soon go sep'rate ways,  
And you found a fool lyin' in a daze.  
Ha, ha, woman, what you gonna do,  
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you.  
It's so good that you're feelin' pain,  
But you better get your face on board the very next train.  
  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
  
Evil woman, how you done me wrong,  
But now you're tryin' to wail a diff'rent song.  
Ha, ha, funny, how you broke me up.  
You made the wine, now you drink a cup.  
I came runnin' ev'ry time you cried,  
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes.

Well she drew out all her money from the southern trust  
And put her little boy on the greyhound bus  
Leaving memphis with a guitar in his hand  
With a one way ticket to the promised land  
Hey little girl with the red dress on  
There's party tonight down in memphis down  
I'll be going down there if you need a ride  
The man on the radio says elvis presley's died  
We drove to memphis the sky was hard and black  
Up over the ridge came a white cadillac  
They drawed out all his money and they laid him in the back  
A woman cried from the roadside "oh he's gone, he's gone"  
They found him slumped up against the drain  
With a whole lotta trouble running through his veins  
Bye bye johnny  
Johnny bye bye  
You didn't have to die  
You didn't have to die

She walked in like a lady, with a glass of pink champagne  
I wouldn't look if you paid me, 'cause to me she's still the same  
Well you oughtta see her, wearin' her heart on her sleeves  
You'd never believe her, she's got a well-planned look in her eyes  
  
She's so European, she's one of a kind, one of a kind  
She's so European, she's one of a kind, all in her mind  
And she's so European, I found out today  
  
She still speaks with an accent from a week in San Tropez  
She makes love on her brass bed 'cause her parents are still away  
Well you oughta see her, countin' the stars in her eyes  
You'd never believe her, she's got a well-planned coverless smile  
  
She's so European, she's one of a kind, all in her mind  
She's so European, she's one of a kind, all in her mind  
And she's so European, she told me today  
  
I wanna hold her tight all through the night, I must be dreamin'  
I wanna take my time, she's so refined, is that her screamin'  
  
I've seen the looks in your eyes, you've seen through her disguise, yeah  
  
She's so European, she's so European, one of a kind, all in her mind...



I dreamed I saw St. Augustine  
Alive as you or me  
Tearing through these quarters  
In the utmost misery  
With a blanket underneath his arm  
And a coat of solid gold  
Searching for the very souls  
Whom already have been sold.  
  
"Arise, arise", he cried so loud  
With a voice without restraint  
"Come out ye gifted kings and queens  
And hear my sad complaint  
No martyr is among ye now  
Whom you can call your own  
So go on your way accordingly  
But know you're not alone".  
  
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine  
Alive with fiery breath  
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones  
That put him out to death  
Oh, I awoke in anger  
So alone and terrified  
I put my fingers against the glass  
And bowed my head and cried.



Here comes Santa Claus  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Right down  
Santa Claus Lane  
  
Vixen, Blitzen  
And all his reindeer  
Pulling on the reins

Hang your stockings  
And say your prayers  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Comes tonight  
  
Here comes Santa Claus

Jingle jangle  
What a beautiful sight  
Jump in bed  
Cover up your head  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Comes tonight  
  
Here comes Santa Claus

That makes everything right  
Fill your hearts  
With Christmas cheer  
'Cause Santa Claus

If we  
Just follow the light  
Let's give thanks  
To the Lord above  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Is comin' tonight  
'Cause Santa Claus  
Is comin' tonight  
'Cause Santa Claus

Everybody's talkin' at me  
I don't hear a word they're sayin',  
Only the echoes of my mind  
  
People stoppin' starin'  
I don't see the faces,  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'  
Through the pourin' rain  
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes  
Bankin' off the northeast wind  
Sailin' on a summer breeze  
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone  
  
People stoppin' starin'  
I don't see the faces,  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'  
Through the pourin' rain  
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes  
Bankin' off the northeast wind  
Sailin' on a summer breeze  
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone  
  
Everybody's talkin' at me



Baby I forgot somethin', that's why I came home  
It's somethin' I really need, I know you thought I was gone  
No, it's not my gloves honey, it's not that cold today  
It's nothin' I left behind, it's somethin' I got to say  
I forgot to say I love you  
And something else that I missed, to say how much I need you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This  
It's easy to feel all alone  
You give me the strength I need to exist  
Just hold me and don't let me go  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This  
  
Sometimes I don't know lately, what will ease the pain?  
On every corner of the street, sometimes it's all too insane  
Baby you just got somethin', that's why I came home  
It's somethin' I really need, an' now we can be alone  
  
I just had to say I love you, and something else that I missed  
To say how much I need you  
  
(Chorus)  
  
It's easy to fear the unknown  
I always know when fate gives a twist  
You'll be there to soften the blow  
  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This - Ooh, Ooh  
You give me the strength I need to exist  
Just hold me and don't let me go  
  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This  
It's easy to feel all alone  
I always know when fate gives a twist  
You'll be there to soften the blow  
  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This - Ooh, Ooh  
You give me the strength I need to exist  
Just hold me and don't let me go  
  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This  
When all my defenses are low  
I always know when fate gives a twist  
You'll be there to soften the blow  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This.....



In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear  
And what insane and silly things we do.  
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear,  
As I recall it, you were in it, too.  
  
I had the craziest dream, last night, yes I did  
I never dreamed it could be  
Yet there you were, in love with me  
  
I found your lips close to mine, so I kissed them  
And you didn't mind it at all  
When I'm awake, such a break never happens  
How long can I guy go on dreaming  
  
If there's a chance that you care  
Then, please, say that you do baby  
Say it and make my craziest dream come true



I want to see you again.  
I don't care where and I don't care when.  
I want to see you again,  
Cause this beginning will have no end.  
Bring your whips, bring your chains.  
We can exchange names.  
I want to see you again.  
I want to see you again.  
I feel a feeling since I don't know when.  
I want to see you again,  
So you can know you have a friend.  
You're so passive.  
I'm filled with wrath.  
We could take a bath.  
I want to see you again.  
Oh, there's talk of the lights on Broadway  
And hearts intertwining high above,  
And if frankly we'll see things my way,  
We will climb the heights of love.  
I want to see you again.  
It doesn't matter where or when.  
I want to see you again.  
I'm just beginning to have no end.  
Perfect love.  
Cast out fear.  
Let me, buy you a beer.  
I want to see you again,  
And again,  
And again.  
I want to see you again.  
I want to see you again  
I want to see you again  
I want to see you again



The witching hour has arrived here too soon  
I know that all my dreams are inside this room  
Oh yeah, it's all in this tune  
  
Dreams in the night, they're falling like rain  
Dreams in the night, they drive me insane  
  
They cannot wait until I turn off the light  
When I'm asleep they've got the key to my mind  
Oh yeah, can't leave them behind  
  
Dreams in the night, they're falling like rain  
Dreams in the night, they drive me insane  
Dreams in the night.  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, give me another dream now  
  
The Spider's lullaby is all they can sing  
As they inject their poison into my brain  
Oh yeah, they're calling my name  
  
Dreams in the night, they're falling like rain  
Dreams in the night, they drive me insane  
  
Give me another dream now  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, give me another dream now  
  
Rainbows and waterfalls  
Little girls are swimming in a pond of gold  
I'm growing old  
I'm growing old  
Sweet blue eyes of innocence  
Begging me  
To follow them to the other side  
Ah, they're growing horns  
  
Dreams in the night, they're falling like rain  
Dreams in the night, they drive me insane  
Dreams in the night  
  
Let me out of these dreams, dreams, dreams  
Let me out of these dreams, dreams, dreams,  
Let me out of these dreams, dreams, dreams



Oh the hills are full of spirits  
And they walk when night comes round  
And they speak to who they choose to  
When the moon is shining down  
And ramona loves the orchard  
And liza loves the pine  
And cyrus in the moonlight  
Loves the flowing of the wine  
  
Oh cyrus trusts the spirits  
And they fill his life with grace  
Yeah the father of his fathers  
Passed him down the gift of faith  
And one night you might hear it  
Like a wailing from above  
It's just cyrus in the moonlight  
Singing to the one he loves...  
  
And the two girls start to dancing  
When they hear that drunken voice  
That's when cyrus asks the moonlight  
Do I have to make a choice  
'tween liza with her red hair  
And ramona with her blues  
And with all these gifts they bring me  
Tell me how can I refuse  
  
Well the hills are full of spirits  
And they walk when night comes round  
And they speak to who they choose to  
When the moon is shining down  
And ramona loves the orchard  
And liza loves the pine  
And cyrus in the moonlight  
Loves the flowing of the wine  
And one night you might hear it  
Like a wailing from above  
It's just cyrus in the moonlight  
Singing to the one he loves...

When you're feeling sad and lonely there's a service I can render.  
Tell the one who loves you only, I can be so warm and tender.  
Call me, don't be afraid you can call me, maybe it's late but just call me.  
Call me and I'll be around.  
When its seems your friends desert you, there's somebody thinking of you.  
I'm the one who'll never hurt you, maybe it's because I love you.  
Call me, don't be afraid you can call me, maybe it's late but just call me.  
Call me and I'll be around.

[Chorus:]  
Here we go, vertigo  
Video vertigo  
Test for echo  
Here we go, in slo-mo  
Video vertigo  
Test for echo  
  
Some kind of trouble on the sensory screen  
Camera curves over caved-in cop cars  
Bleacher-creatures, would-be desperados  
Clutch at plausible deniability  
Don't touch that dial,  
We're in denial  
Until the showcase trial on TV  
  
Some kind of pictures on the sense o'clock news  
Miles of yellow tape, silhouetted chalk lines  
Tough-talking hood boys in pro-team logo knock-offs  
Conform to uniforms of some corporate entity  
Don't change that station  
It's Gangster Nation  
Now crime's in syndication on TV  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some kind of drama live on satellite  
Hidden camera coverage from the crime scene to the courtroom  
Nail-biting hood boys in borrowed ties and jackets  
Clutching at the straws of respectability  
Can't do the time?  
Don't do the crime  
And wind up in the perp. walk on TV



Deep down in my heart  
There is a lot of words  
Tears fall down my face  
But I hear the many voices that cry in pain  
  
I want to tell you  
Don't give it up  
I want to tell you  
Don't give it up  
Don't give it up  
  
Hear the voices, wraps around you  
All the people, never doubt it  
Hear the voices, take a look at what's around you  
All the people, we can change things never doubt it  
  
We won't take new start  
Is it just too much to ask?  
Ooh, what does it take?  
'Cause I hear a million people singing the same  
  
I want to tell you  
Don't give it up  
I want to tell you  
Don't give it up  
Don't give it up  
  
Hear the voices, wraps around you  
All the people, never doubt it  
Hear the voices, take a look at what's around you  
All the people, we can change it  
We can change it  
  
Hear the voices, all the people  
Hear the voices, all the people  
  
Hear the voices, all the people  
All the people  
Hear the voices, all the people  
  
Hear the voices, all the people [Repeat: x5]

In the nights of lost and found  
Many strangers are around  
You're nobody until someone will love you  
You can't make it on your own  
When you standing there alone  
Many heartaches keep the world on turning  
'Cause you are fooled by your feeling  
You can pay the price of love  
Give me your hand, my love  
Give me your heart  
  
Oh oh oh  
Let me be your lover  
You're undercover, yeah tonight  
Oh oh oh  
Let me be your lover

We are all romantic warriors  
Fighting for your love  
Oh oh oh

Fighting for your heart  
We're fighting for your love  
  
Legends have a broken heart  
There's someone who tore apart  
Oh, there must be more to life than this, babe  
Idol love can't last through years  
How can love, babe, last through years ?  
You're surrounded, baby, oh by strangers  
Come let me be your hero  
And I'm fighting for your love  
Give me your hand, my love  
Give me your heart



Feels like nothin' happens fast enough  
Well maybe I just want too much  
But when something's wrong between us, baby  
Nothin' feels right  
  
I think it's time we cleared the air  
Take a long drive far away somewhere  
Tell me everything you feel inside  
We got nothin' but time  
  
Slide over, baby  
Here by my side  
I want to take you on a slow ride  
On a slow ride  
  
Your history shows on your face  
Yeah, you've been hurt you've been betrayed  
Now we can't change the past, but we can  
Leave it behind  
  
We'll forget about tomorrow, baby  
We'll just steal away into the night  
And we'll just be two shadows, darlin'  
In the dashboard light  
  
Slide over, baby  
Here by my side  
I want to take you on a slow ride  
On a slow ride



Come and gather around at the table  
In the spirit of family and friends  
And we'll all join hands and remember this moment  
'Til the season comes 'round again  
  
Let's all try to smile for the picture  
And we'll hold it as long as we can  
May it carry us through  
Should we ever get lonely  
'Til the season comes 'round again  
  
[Chorus:]  
One night holy and bright  
Shining with love from our hearts  
By a warm fire,  
Let's lift our heads high  
And be thankful we're here  
'Til this time next year  
  
May the new year be blessed  
With good tidings  
'Til the next time I see you again  
If we must say goodbye  
Let the spirit go with you  
'Til the season comes 'round again  
  
[Chorus]  
May the new year be blessed with good tidings  
'Til the next time I see you again  
If we must say goodbye  
Let the spirit go with you  
And we'll love and we'll laugh  
In the time that we had  
'Til the season comes 'round again

'Cause it don't always have a happy ending  
  
Love ain't like no fairy tale  
  
It'll break your heart  
  
'Cause it don't always have a happy ending  
  
Mama said you better watch yourself

And if you fall you gotta be strong  
  
'Cause love ain't like no fairy tale  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Every time I see you 'round the way

A picture perfect world is what I saw  
  
A picket fence, a house, a fancy car  
  
No, no, no, no, no, no  
  
I just knew that you were heaven sent  
  
You would make all of my wishes come true  
  
You'd be my knight in shining armor some day  
  
I was your princess soon to be queen  
  
Love ain't like no fairy tale  
  
Repeat 1  
  
I just knew that you were heaven sent

Well, I don't know why I came here tonight  
I got the feeling something ain't right  
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair  
And I'm wondering if I'll get down the stairs  
Yeah clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right  
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you  
Stuck in the middle with you  
Well, I'm stuck in the middle with you  
And I'm wondering what is I should do  
It's so hard to wipe this smile from my face  
Lose control and I'm all over the place  
Yeah clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right  
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you  
Well, you started out with nothing  
And you're proud, you're a self-made man  
And your friends they all come crawling  
Slap you on the back and say, "Please, oh please"  
Oh no  
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right  
Here I am  
Well, you started out with nothing  
And you're proud, you're a self-made man  
And your friends they all come crawling  
Slap you on the back and say, "Please, oh please"  
Well, I don't know why I came here tonight  
I got the feeling something ain't right  
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair  
And I'm wondering if I'll get down, get get down the stairs  
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right  
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you  
Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you  
Stuck in the middle with you  
Here I am, well here I am stuck in the middle with you  



I spent a lot of time looking for me in your eyes  
I spent a lot of nights sleeping on the end of our bed  
Then I realize that this time, time won't tell  
People like myself can't compromise this well  
  
And I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Won't let go so easily...  
I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
  
Said a lot of words that you never wanted to hear  
Used myself up trying to explain and be clear  
Then I realize we mean the things we say  
When you turn the page the words don't go away  
  
And I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Won't let go so easily...  
I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
  
Christopher Columbus aint got much on me  
And maybe just like Moses, I will part the sea  
  
And I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Won't let go so easily...  
I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
  
No, I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
I won't let go, just wait and see...  
I won't fall off the edge of the earth,  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...  
Next time that lucky penny that you find will be me...

I have a band of men and all they do is play for me  
They come from miles around to hear them play a melody  
Beneath the stars my ten guitars will play a song for you  
And if you're with the one you love this is what you do  
  
Oh, dance, dance, dance to my ten guitars  
And very soon you know just where you are  
Through the eyes of love you see a thousand stars  
When you dance, dance, dance, to my ten guitars  
  
Guitars are made for love my band of men will always say  
So give each one a pretty girl and they will start to play  
Beneath the stars my ten guitars will play a song for you  
And if you're with the one you love this is what to do  
  
Oh, dance, dance, dance to my ten guitars  
And very soon you know just where you are  
Through the eyes of love you see a thousand stars  
When you dance, dance, dance, to my ten guitars  
  
Ooh, let me tell you now  
Dance, dance, dance to my ten guitars  
Hmm, come on, everybody,  
Dance dance dance to my ten guitars



Well this life that I've lead has took me everywhere  
There ain't no place I ain't never gone  
But it's kind of like the saying that you heard so many times  
Well there just ain't no place like home  
Did you ever see a she-gator protect her young  
Or a fish in a river swimming free  
Did you ever see the beauty of the hills of Carolina  
Or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee  
And lord I can't make any changes  
All I can do is write 'em in a song  
I can see the concrete slowly creepin'  
Lord take me and mine before that comes  
  
Do you like to see a mountain stream a-flowin'  
Do you like to see a young gun with his dog  
Did you ever stop to think about, well, the air your breathin'  
Well you better listen to my song  
And lord I can't make any changes  
All I can do is write 'em in a song  
I can see the concrete slowly creepin'  
Lord take me and mine before that comes  
  
I'm not tryin' to put down no big cities  
But the things they write about us is just a bore  
Well you can take a boy out of ol' dixieland  
But you'll never take ol' Dixie from a boy  
And lord I can't make any changes  
All I can do is write 'em in a song  
I can see the concrete slowly creepin'  
Lord take me and mine before that comes  
'Cause I can see the concrete slowly creepin'  
Lord take me and mine before that comes



No matter where I go, London, Paris, Mexico.  
Anywhere on Earth, they know my place of birth.  
I met a girl from London when she sat on Blackpool Pier,  
She said she could tell, I'm a Lad from Lancashire.  
She said, "Are you a nudist?" So I blushed and said, "No fear".  
I'm covered up like a Lad from Lancashire.  
  
North or South, when I open my mouth, they know that I'm not Dutch,  
They can tell I come from Lancashire, but they can't tell me much.  
I whispered, "I'll be nudist if you'll be the same my dear."  
She said, "No fear, with a Lad from Lancashire.  
A widow nice and young and gay said, "Come to tea my dear,  
I've something nice for a Lad from Lancashire."  
We sat down on the sofa and I felt her creeping near,  
I said, "Hee Hee! take care, I'm a Lad from Lancashire."  
  
North and South, when I open my mouth, they know that I'm not Dutch,  
They can tell I come from Lancashire, but they can't tell me much.  
The widow started kissing me and tickling my ear,  
I tickled her, like a Lad from Lancashire.  
I went with Jane down Lovers Lane, she whispered in her ear,  
"Now do your best for a Lad from Lancashire."  
She said to me when on my knee, "You can't do that there ere."  
I said, "Hey Hey! I can, I'm the Lad from Lancashire."  
  
North and South, when I open my mouth, they know that I'm not Dutch,  
They can tell I come from Lancashire, but they can't tell me much.  
That night when Jane got home again her Ma said, "You look queer,  
I'll bet thas' been with that Lad from Lancashire.

You can kick me out of a real good jive  
You can use my friendship like a doorknob  
You can make me super Styrofoam  
You can make me feel all alone  
You can stuff hamburger in my head  
But I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
  
You can tempt me with a pretty girl  
You can call on me in fancy fur  
You can say, "Just do it, everyone is"  
You can tell me that it's just showbiz  
You can turn my life from green to red  
But I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
  
You can burn my bridges down for laughin', ha ha ha ha  
You can call me a fool for crashin', woh  
You can make me stare down at the floor  
You can make me listen while you snore  
You can do all these things that I have said  
But I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
Let's go!  
  
You can make my position low as a dog  
You can trick me with your social fog  
You can criticize my very bag  
You can call my treasures a heap of slag  
But you might as well eat lunch instead  
Cause I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
I ain't gonna be no squarehead

Driving in your Escalade flash that golden grill

I'm lazy, you know it  
I'm ready for the second show  
Amazin', thing growing  
Just waitin' for the juice to flow  
  
But you're so very picturesque  
You're so very cold  
Tastes like roses on your breath  
But graveyards on your soul  
  
I'm hurting, I'm wanting  
I'm aching for another go  
You're squirming wet, baby  
Nothin' bad comin' very slow  
And it's burnin' holes in me  
  
You're so very picturesque  
You're so very cold  
It tastes like roses on your breath  
But graveyards on your soul... whoa-oh  
  
One spastic explosion  
Two pressure-cookers go insane  
It makes me act crazy  
I shiver but I love this game  
  
You're so very ordinary  
You're so very lame  
Tastes like whiskey on your lips  
And earthworms rule your brain



Written by russ ballard, (C)1983  
Found on your move and the very best of america.  
  
I've been in love, girl, so many times before  
They'd love me and leave me, i thought i knew the score  
I'd fall in love no more  
I was walking in shadows then, my life a lonely road  
I was walking to nowhere, with a heavy loaded heart  
To laugh i played the part  
  
(do, do, do ... ) then came that magic day  
I saw you as you walked my way  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Yeah, you're my kinda woman  
And i can't help but tell you that you are (you are)  
Yes, you know you are  
Girl, you know you are (yes you are, you know you are, you know you are)  
  
The longer together then, the more we fell in love  
No makin' or breakin' up, now i know i found real love  
And i can't get enough (oo, i love you, i really love you)  
So good to be winnin' now, i never thought i'd do  
You got me spinnin', honey it's all down to you  
You're there to see me through (oo, i love you, i really love you, yes i love
you)  
  
(do, do, do ... ) and from just one kiss  
Who would believe that it would be like this  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Yeah, you're my kinda woman  
And i can't help but tell you that you are (you are)  
Yes, you know you are  
Girl, you know you are (yes you are, you know you are, you know you are)  
  
My kinda woman i know that this is really love  
There'll be no breakin' up, oh no  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Yeah, you're my kinda woman  
And i can't help but tell you that you are (you are)  
Yes, you know you are  
Girl, you know you are (yes you are, you know you are)  
Oh, yes you are



Let me rock you, let me roll you  
Take my hand  
I will take you to a new start  
Calling the promised land  
Let me love you, let me hold you  
With all my heart  
Trust me baby, like I trust you  
I did it from the start  
And each and every day  
I'm gonna always say  
  
Let's talk about love, love, love, love  
That's all I'm dreaming of  
Let's talk about love  
It's up to you  
To make your dreams come true  
Look in my eyes, there's a way  
Don't throw your dreams away  
You'll never lose  
Keep love alive  
Babe, then our love survive  
  
Let me rock you, let me roll you  
I'll be close to you  
We can have a one way trip to paradise for two  
There's so much  
I can give you  
I'll give all my heart  
We can always be together  
And never break apart  
And each and every day I'm gonna always say



I saw the man at J.F.K.  
He took your ticket yesterday  
In the humdrum  
  
I ride tandem with a random  
Things don't run the way I planned them  
In the humdrum  
  
Hey Valentina, do you want me to beg?  
You got me cooking I'm a hard boiled egg  
In the humdrum  
  
Empty my mind, I find it hard to cope  
Listen to my heart, don't need no stethoscope  
  
Seem to me that television  
She come to cut me a deep incision  
In the humdrum  
  
Empty my mind, I find it hard to cope  
Listen to my heart - don't need no stethoscope  
  
Out of woman come the man  
Spend the rest of his life gettin' back where he can  
As a bow, so a dove  
As below, so above  
From the black hole  
Come the tadpole  
With the dark soul  
In coal she burn, she burn  
  
As I drove into the sun  
Didn't dare look where I had begun  
Lost among echoes of things not there  
Watching the sound forming shapes in the air  
From the white star  
Came the bright scar  
Our amoeba  
My little liebe schoen



Bless my life, take away the shame  
Allow me to experience your most amazing grace  
Fill my heart, it's empty and frail  
Make me whole again Lord, mend my broken soul  
  
Refrain:  
I offer my life to You Lord  
With all my strength I worship you  
  
Chorus:  
And I give my all (Take me as I am)  
I am Yours Oh God (Lead me to Your arms)  
And I will give You praise (cause I rejoice in You)  
  
'Til the end of my days I give my all  
  
Intro  
  
Verse 2:  
  
You give Your all, unworthy as I am You have died for me, Lord, and now I am
free  
You're the only reason my heart leaps for joy  
I give You back the glory, Lord mold me and use me  
Refrain  
  
Chorus(2x)  
  
Ending:  
'Til the end of my days I give my all  
'Til the end of my days I give my all



Everybody's lookin' for somethin'  
Somethin' to fill in the holes  
We think a lot but don't talk much about it  
'Til things get out of control  
How do I know when it's love  
I can't tell you but it lasts forever  
How does it feel when it's love  
It's just something you feel together  
When it's love  
You look at every face in a crowd  
Some shine and some keep you guessin'  
Waiting for someone to come into focus  
Teach you your final love lesson  
How do I know when it's love  
I can't tell you but it lasts forever  
How does it feel when it's love  
It's just something you feel together  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh when it's love  
Oh oh oh oh  
You can feel it yeah  
Oh oh oh oh  
Nothing's missing  
Yeah  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Nothing's missing  
How do I know when it's love  
I can't tell you but it lasts forever  
How does it feel when it's love  
I can't tell you but it lasts forever



I look to the east when the day  
Is done and think of it all  
All the thoughts that I've seen of  
Satin seams and tide pool dreams  
I look to the sun  
As the day is dawning  
I carry my dreams  
From a moment before  
I try to recall  
But I find myself yawning  
I guess they are gone but there's more  
So I head out the door  
  
All around, listen and you can  
Hear the sound  
On cloudy days seems like I  
Always feel this way  
  
First break in the day if the time  
Is right and nobody minds  
I stroll down the lane take a breath  
Of air and drift on a dream  
I look to the sun  
As the day is warming  
Consider the things  
That have happened before  
I feel like I'm one  
With the wind on the hillside  
I feel like I'm one with the  
River that runs by my door  
  
All around, listen and you can  
Hear the sound  
On cloudy days seems like I  
Always feel this way  
  
All around, listen and you can  
Hear the sound  
On cloudy days seems like I  
Always feel this way  
  
I look to the sun  
As the day is dawning  
I carry my dreams  
From a moment before  
I feel like I'm one  
With the wind on the hillside  
I feel like I'm one with the  
River that runs by my door  
  
All around, listen and you can  
Hear the sound  
On cloudy days seems like I  
Always feel this way  
  
(repeat and fade)



Happy Holiday  
Happy holiday, happy holiday  
While the merry bells keep ringing  
May your ev'ry wish come true  
  
Happy holiday, happy holiday  
May the calendar keep bringing  
Happy holidays to you  
  
Come To Holiday Inn  
If you're burdened down with trouble  
If your nerves are wearing thin  
Park your load down the road  
And come to Holiday Inn  
  
If the traffic noise affects you  
Like a squeaky violin  
Kick your cares down the stairs  
And come to Holiday Inn  
  
If you can't find someone who  
Would set your heart a-whirl  
Take your car and motor to  
The home of boy meets girl  
  
If you're laid-up with a breakdown  
Throw away your vitamin  
Don't get worse, grab your nurse  
And come to Holiday Inn



All day long he was fighting for you  
And he didn't even know your name  
Young men come and young men go  
But life goes on just the same  
  
And I don't know why  
Why do we keep holding on  
I don't know why  
Pretending to be oh so strong  
Oh why  
Is there something I don't know  
Or something very wrong, with you and me  
Or maybe  
  
That's the way it is, there's nothing I can do,  
That's just the way it is.  
  
They've been waiting for word to come down  
They've been waiting for you night and day  
They won't wait any longer for you  
It may already be too late  
  
And I don't know why.  
  
You see the dying, you feel the pain  
What have you got to say  
If we agree that we can disagree  
We could stop all of this today  
  
It's been your life for as long as you can remember  
But you cannot fight no more  
You must want to look your son in the eyes  
When he asks you what you did it for  
  
'Cos all day long he was fighting for you  
And he didn't even know your name  
Young men come and young men go  
But life goes on just the same  
  
I don't know why...



Baby, please stop messin' 'round  
You'll be messin' around all the time  
Baby, please stop messin' around  
You'll be messin' around all the time  
If you don't stop messin' 'round  
You'll be somebody's friend  
Instead of mine, yes sir  
  
You're rockin' the temperature  
My baby's cherry red  
You're rockin' so hard  
I fall right out of bed  
  
I said,  
Baby, please stop messin' 'round  
You'll be messin' around all the time  
If you don't stop messin' 'round  
You'll be somebody's friend  
Instead of mine  
  
You're rockin' the temperature  
My baby's cherry red  
You're rockin' so hard  
I fall right out of bed  
  
I said,  
Baby, please stop messin' 'round  
You'll be messin' around all the time  
If you don't stop messin' 'round  
You'll be somebody's friend  
Instead of mine



Unbound God's creation  
Has grown into the sinner  
Abandoned innocence  
Impenitent transgressor  
Escape mortality  
They say your life can change  
If you take God's hand  
Embrace rebirth  
Your cleansing's so divine  
To be reborn in God's eyes  
  
You'll never touch God's hand  
You'll never taste God's breath  
Because you'll never see the second coming  
Life's too short to be focused on insanity  
I've seen the ways of God  
I'll take the devil any day  
Hail Satan  
  
Your faith has atrophied  
And rots in hell's asylum  
Despondence tears you down  
A free-falling social strain  
Escape atrocity  
They say your life can change  
If you take God's hand  
Embrace rebirth  
Your cleansing's so divine  
To be reborn to God's lies  
  
You'll never touch God's hand  
You'll never taste God's breath  
Because you'll never see the second coming  
It's all a fuckin' mockery  
No grasp upon reality  
It's mind control for  
Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ  
  
You'll never touch God's hand  
You'll never taste God's breath  
Because you'll never see the second coming  
I laugh at the abortion known as Christianity  
I've seen the ways of God  
I'll take the devil any day  
Hail Satan  
  
You'll never touch God's hand  
You'll never taste God's breath  
Because you'll never see the second coming  
It's all a fuckin' mockery  
No grasp upon reality  
It's mind control for  
Compulsory religion and the Skeleton Christ



Proud enough for you to call me arrogant  
Greedy enough to be labeled a thief  
Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man  
Cruel enough for me to feel no grief  
  
Never could have just a part of it  
I always need more to get by  
Getting right down to the heart of it  
The root of all evil has been running my whole life  
  
Dirty enough for me to lust  
Leaving nothing left to trust  
Jealous enough to still feel envious  
Lazy enough to sleep all day  
And let my life just waste away  
Selfish enough to make you wait for me  
  
Driven blindly by our sins  
Misled so easily  
Entirely ready to leave it behind  
I'm begging to break free  
  
Take all of me  
The desires that keep burning deep inside  
Cast them all away  
And help to give me strength to face another day  
I am ready  
Help me be what I can be  
  
Self-centered fear has got a hold me  
Clutching my throat  
Self righteous anger running all through me  
Ready to explode  
  
Procrastination paralyzing me  
Wanting me dead  
These obsessions that keep haunting me  
Won't leave my head  
  
Help to do for me what I can't do myself  
Take this fear and pain  
I can't break out of this prison all alone  
Help me break these chains  
  
Humility now my only hope  
Won't you take all of me  
Heal this dying soul  
  
I can feel my body breaking  
I can feel my body breaking  
I'm ready to let it all go  
I can feel my body shaking  
Right down to the foundation  
The root of it all  
  
Take all of me  
And the drive that keep burning deep inside  
Cast it all away  
And help to give me strength to face another day  
I am ready  
Help me be what I can be  
I am ready  
Come to me  
Take me away



Now you want to know the reason  
Why I cheated on you  
Well I had to be a hunter again  
This little man had to try  
  
To make love feel new again  
'Cause there's just a few things honey  
I'm not old enough to do for you  
You just never care to show me  
  
Showed him how to tango  
And when they tangoed it'd send their hearts a flutter  
Young and tender  
Seemed to surrender in so sweet surrender  
  
In sweet surrender  
Ahh sweet surrender to love  
But now you're gonna go out and get yourself  
A reputation  
  
But I'm gonna have to show you where to start  
And then you're gonna bring back your little reputation  
And prove to me what I could not prove to you



I swear sometimes you're taking me for granted  
I swear sometime you're a whore  
I swear but I know there ain't no reason  
Cause everything is such a bore  
  
At night I had a dream, though it made me sick  
Saw you in your bedroom sucking someone else's dick, (my goodness!)  
My friends all laughed, said it was my fault  
Said it's time that it happened to me  
But I know that the show was much more than a blow  
So I'm waiting for the tide to get low  
Waiting for the tide to get low  
  
If I was an ant, live upon the wall  
Tell me baby would it make any difference at all  
If I was a roach on a tree tell me would you smoke me?  
Bright lights put me in a trance  
But it ain't house music, makes me want to dance (word)  
I don't gamble but I bet  
I'm gonna die if I don't get a cigarette  
Hold me close I always play the mack  
With the monkey on my back.



I. At the Tobes of Hades  
The Tobes of Hades  
Lit by flickering torchlight  
The Netherworld is gathered in the glare  
Prince By-Tor takes the cavern  
To the north light  
The sign of Eth is rising in the air  
By-Tor, knight of darkness,  
Centurion of evil  
Devil's prince  
  
II. Across the Styx  
Across the River Styx  
Out of the lamplight  
His nemesis is waiting at the gate  
The Snow Dog, ermine glowing  
In the damp night  
Coal-black eyes shimmering with hate  
By-Tor and the Snow Dog  
Square for battle  
Let the fray begin  
  
III. Of the Battle  
  
Instrumental  
  
IV. Epilogue  
The battle's over  
And the dust is clearing  
Disciples of the Snow Dog sound the knell  
Rejoicing echoes  
As the dawn is nearing  
By-Tor in defeat  
Retreats to Hell  
Snow Dog is victorious  
The land of the Overworld  
Is saved again



I woke up this morning  
With an attitude  
Looked at the headlines  
Put me in a real bad mood  
Sitting here remember  
Tryin' to stay sane  
Between the end of the summer  
And the comin' of the blessed rains  
And I feel dirty  
All the way down  
I feel dirty, baby  
Like this dirty town  
I gave you everything  
On a silver tray  
Could have been a fool forever  
But I'm not made that way  
  
And after all these years  
I think it's time to say goodbye  
I'm doing you a favor  
I will not help you live a lie  
And believe me,  
If you think I'm gonna catch you when you fall  
You don't know me  
You don't know me at all  
  
I closed up the curtains  
Learned to confess  
Baby I knew better  
But you were such a pretty mess  
You took my breath away  
And now I want it back  
Aah, you should have killed me  
Cause you always looked so good in black  
  
And after all these twisted roads  
That we've been down together  
I think it's time to say goodbye  
And believe me,  
If you think I'm gonna get down and crawl  
You don't know me  
You don't know me at all  
  
Oooooo  
  
After all these years  
I think it's time to say goodbye  
I'm doing us a favor, baby  
You know I cannot live a lie  
And when you need me,  
And you think I'm gonna be there when you call  
You don't know me  
You don't know me at all  
You don't know me at all, la de da  
You don't know me at all  
You don't know me at all



On the side of a hill in a land called 'Somewhere'  
A little boy lies asleep in the earth  
While down in the valley a cruel war rages  
And people forget what a child's life is worth  
  
On the side of a hill, a little cloud weeps  
And waters the grave with its silent tears  
While a soldier cleans and polishes a gun  
That ended a life at the age of seven years  
  
And the war rages on in the land called 'Somewhere'  
And generals order their men to kill  
And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten  
While the little cloud weeps on the side of a hill



There's no business like show business like no business I know  
Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow  
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow  
  
There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low  
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the
cold  
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show  
  
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk  
Are secretly unhappy men because  
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk  
Get paid for what they do but no applause.  
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?  
  
There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so  
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on
opening nights  
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there
in lights  
  
There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low  
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's
no attack  
Where could you get money that you don't give back? let's go on with the show  
  
(There's no business like show business like no business I know)  
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn  
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on  
  
(There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low)  
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there
you are  
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the
show!!



Go.  
Disjointed we scare ourselves with all that we wanna be.  
Just got paid and now you're going, how long should you be?  
If I get scared, I just call you.  
And I, miss your glow as I unsettle,  
Oh I'll always feel, I'll always be.  
Right.  
  
One, two, three, four.  
  
So sell your suit and tie, and come and live with me.  
Leukemia, schizophrenia, polyethylene.  
There is no significant risk to your health.  
She used to be beautiful once as well.  
  
Plastic bag, middle class, polyethylene.  
Decaffeinate, unleaded, keep all surfaces clean.  
If you don't believe in it, sell your soul.  
If you don't get into it, no one will.  
Oh...... Oh........



Why must you treat me as if I were only a friend  
What have I done that's made you so different and cold  
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again  
Will you be happy when you are withered and old  
  
I cannot offer you diamonds or mansions so fine  
I cannot offer you clothes that your young body crave  
But if you'll say that forever that you will be mine  
Think of the heartaches the tears and the sorrow you'll save  
  
When you are weary and tired of another one's gold  
When you are lonely remember this letter my own  
Don't try to answer though I've suffered anguish untold  
If you don't love me I wish you would leave me alone  
  
While I am writing this letter I think of the past  
And of the promises that you are breaking so free  
But soon I'll bid my farewells to this whole world at last  
I will be gone when you read this last letter from me



It ain't over till it's over  
  
Here we are still together  
We are one  
So much time wasted  
Playing games with love  
  
So many tears, I've cried  
So much pain inside  
But baby, it ain't over till it's over  
  
So many years we've tried  
To keep our love alive  
But baby it ain't over till it's over  
  
How many times did we give up  
But we always worked things out  
And all my doubts and fear  
Kept me wondering if I'd always be in love  
  
So many tears, I've cried  
So much pain inside  
But baby, it ain't over till it's over  
  
So many years we've tried  
To keep our love alive  
But baby it ain't over till it's over  
  
So many tears, I've cried  
So much pain inside  
But baby, it ain't over till it's over  
  
So many years we've tried  
To keep our love alive  
But baby it ain't over till it's over



Yeah yeah yeah  
Julie was a long way from home  
She can make alone look pretty  
Her attitude made a part of her landscape  
Riding her bike through alphabet city  
  
She likes to party in the backseat, under the bridge on the Brooklyn side  
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise  
She said "what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"  
She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
(Right now right now ooh ooh ooh)  
  
Julie likes to shop lift in stores  
Right alongside the rich and famous  
Get in elevators, press emergency stop  
And make love on the floor until the camera made us  
  
And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire  
When she walked, I followed, when she laughed, I cried,  
"What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"  
And I was wrapped around her finger, and I began to believe  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
  
Tell me what you want from me  
I've got everything you need  
It's getting hard for me to breathe  
Let me be your guarantee  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (a game)  
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day (by day)  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl (poster girl)  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (just a game)  
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
  
Right now, right now  
Right now, oh oh oh  
Poster girl  
Poster girl  
Come on, come on



The love line is never straight and narrow  
Unless your love is tried and true  
We take a chance with new beginnings  
Still we try win or lose  
Take the highs with the blues  
  
Always one more  
You're never satisfied  
Share one for all with you  
It's only one for me  
Ah, why draw the line  
And meet you half the way  
And you don't know  
What the means, oh yeah!  
  
I feel like a runnning politician, oh!  
Just trying to please you all the time  
I've given you myself with no conditions  
Going wide, running long  
Feeling lost but not for long...  
  
Always one more  
You're never satisfied  
Share one for all with you  
It's only one for me  
So why draw the line  
And meet you half the way  
When you don't know  
What that means, oh yeah!  
  
Solo  
Always one more  
You're never satisfied  
Share one for all with you  
It's only one for me  
So why draw the line  
And meet you half the way  
When you don't know  
What that means.  
  
I'll meet you half the way  
Whoa yeah.  
I'll meet you half the way  
Whoa yeah.



[Verse 1]  
It's just another day  
It's just another year  
"One step at a time", they say  
"One trip, and you're back that way"  
I don't recognize these eyes  
I don't recognize these hands  
Please believe me when I tell you  
That this is not who I am  
  
[Chorus]  
If I recover, will you take me back again?  
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in  
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be  
If only I could go back when I was me  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'll try hard to make this ride  
I'll try hard to win this fight  
"One step at a time", they say  
"One trip, and you're back that way"  
I don't recognize these eyes  
I don't recognize these hands  
Please believe me when I tell you  
That this is not who I am  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Give me strength to fight  
Help me feel alive again  
Make me whole inside  
Instead, this hole inside is killing me  
Oh, I'm begging you  
  
[Chorus]



Didn't know 'till today  
That you would love for me to say  
All of the things I feel  
Though you don't doubt they're real  
  
Insecure, very shy  
Are the only reasons I have why  
I never say the things that  
You would love to hear  
All the words I try  
Disappoint me and I cry  
So they're words I don't often say  
  
But it's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart  
That loved you from the start  
It's in my heat, it's in the spirit  
And it's got me totally high  
It's just hard me to say why  
  
Kind of sad, kind of blue  
Because I wanted to tell you  
That you are in my heart  
Though we are far apart  
Didn't know how to say  
All the little things to make you stay  
And not to keep assuming  
You could read my mind  
  
You're the one I love  
Though it's hard for you to know  
'Cause the words I don't always say  
  
But it's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart  
That loved you from the start  
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit  
And it's got me totally high  
It's just hard me to say why  
  
It's hard for me



Who do you think you are  
What do you think this is  
A game you can play tryin' to steal him away  
Well I don't need a heartache like this  
Well don't think I don't go through hell  
But heaven is what we both want  
He's easy to love but he's hard to give up  
And if you think I will well you're wrong  
The best woman wins I will fight 'til the end  
I'll lay down and die if I must  
I'll beg and I'll plead I will suffer and bleed  
But he must make a choice between us  
This soap opera play that we're in  
Is just like you watch on t.v.  
But I never thought that I'd ever get caught in it  
Starring you him and me  
In love as in war all is fair  
So a fight to the finish begins  
When you fight from desire you fight fire with fire  
So may the best woman win  
The best woman wins I will fight 'til the end  
I'll lay down and die if I must  
I'll beg and I'll plead I will suffer and bleed  
But he must make a choice between us  
So may the best woman win  
May the best woman win  
May the best woman win  
I'll never give up or give in  
So may the best woman win (best woman win)  
The best woman win (best woman win)  
The best woman win (best woman win)  
I'll never give up or give in  
So may the best woman win  
May the best woman win  
May the best woman win (best woman win)  
I'll never give up or give in  
So may the best woman win  



We'll be together again  
I've been waiting for a long time  
We're gonna be we're gonna be  
Together again  
I've been connected to the right line  
We'll be together and nobody ain't never  
Gonna disconnect us or ever separate us  
Or say to us you've got to  
  
Stop!  
Stand there where you are  
Before you go too far  
Before you make a fool out of love  
Stop!  
Don't jump before you look  
Get hung upon a hook  
Before you make a fool out of love  
  
We'll be together again  
I've been waiting for a long time  
We're gonna be we're gonna be  
Together again  
I've been connected to the right line  
We'll be together and nobody ain't never  
Gonna disconnect us or ever separate us  
Or say to us you've got to  
  
Stop!  
Stand there where you are  
Before you go too far  
Before you make a fool out of love  
Stop!  
Don't jump before you look  
Get hung upon a hook  
Before you make a fool out of love  
  
We'll be together and nobody ain't never  
Gonna disconnect us or ever separate us  
Or say to us you've got to  
  
Stop!  
Stand there where you are  
Before you go too far  
Before you make a fool out of love  
Stop!  
Don't jump before you look  
Get hung upon a hook  
Before you make a fool out of love  
  
Stop!  
Stand there where you are  
Before you go too far  
Before you make a fool out of love  
Stop!  
Don't jump before you look  
Get hung upon a hook  
Before you make a fool out of love  
  
Stop!  
Stand there where you are  
Before you go too far  
Before you make a fool out of love  
Stop!  
Don't jump before you look  
Get hung upon a hook  
Before you make a fool out of love  
  
Stop!



Jump in my love car  
Don't have to go very far  
Just far enough to show you a thing or two  
  
I can really swing  
The best of everything  
And I want to have a thing with you  
  
High roller  
What I buy is mine  
And I always get the things that I choose  
My, my, my, such a high roller  
I know he's gone away and left you  
I'll take real good care of you  
  
I'm in the mood for love  
You're all I'm thinking of  
I'll make you feel alright when we're alone  
  
I can really swing  
The best of everything  
And I want to have a thing with you  
  
High roller  
What I buy is mine  
And I always get the things that I choose  
My, my, my, such a high roller, is that you?  
I knew you'd be here tonight  
And I'll make it alright  
I'll take real good care of you  
I'll tuck you in tonight  
And I'll make it alright  
I know he's gone away and left you  
I'll take real good care of you



There's a sense of longing in me  
As I read Rosemary's letter  
Her writing's honest  
Can't forget the years she's lost  
  
In isolation  
She talks about her love  
And as I read  
"I'll die alone"  
I know she was aching  
  
There's a certain detail seen here  
The pen must have slipped to the side  
And left a stain  
Next to his name  
She knew he was gone  
  
And isolation  
Is all that would remain  
"The wound in me is pouring out  
To rest on a lover's shore"



Jessie was the prom queen back in nineteen ninety-five  
Punk and super pretty like a goddess on the outside  
She was sweet and funny, popular and cool  
It's got to be a drag when you peak in high school  
  
She left college and she never went back  
She posed for Playboy, made her think that she could act  
Ten years looking for the luck  
Chased her dreams in Cali but her acting kinda sucked  
  
Now she's pushing thirty five, working at Starbucks  
Oh well, nowhere to go but up  
  
Bill and Bobby Ann, Tiffany and Mike  
They seemed to be the kids that did everything right  
Now the boys are doing time for robbing a Korean store  
The girls smoke pot and do internet porn  
  
Bobby's little brother Brett always talked smack  
He learned that you can go too far and never get back  
He was drinking at the wrong place at the wrong time  
He said the wrong thing to the wrong guy  
He got himself stabbed in his one good eye  
  
Life goes south when pretty goes away  
The best that you can get is when you're falling in a good way  
  
Good enough is never enough  
Good enough is never enough  
  
There was nowhere to go but up  
There was nowhere to go but up  
There was nowhere to go  
  
Jimmy found God, Jimmy lost a leg  
Amy married well to a man she hates  
Katie bought a strip club, makes a lot of dough  
Alex sold drugs now he has his own reality show  
  
Life goes south when pretty goes away  
The best that you can get is when you're falling in a good way  
Life goes south when pretty goes away  
The best that you can get is when you're falling in a good way  
  
Good enough is never enough  
Good enough is never enough  
Good enough is never enough  
There was nowhere to go but up



Excuse me? Doctor? Do you have a moment?  
  
A moment? What's the question?  
  
More of a situation, a gentleman in exam 3  
  
What's the problem?  
  
That is the problem, we're not sure  
  
You got the chart?  
  
Right here  
  
Not much here to say  
  
No doctor, no obvious physical trauma. Vitals are stable  
  
Name?  
  
No sir  
  
Did someone drop him off?  
Maybe we could speak to them  
Let's get some background on this fella  
  
No ID. Nothing  
And he won't speak to anybody  
  
Well, let's say hello  
Good morning, I'm Dr. Lawson  
How are you today? How are you today?  
Look son, you're in a safe place  
We wanna help in whatever way we can  
But you need to talk to us  
We can't help you otherwise  
What's happened? Tell me everything



If you should need me deep in the night  
My arms around you in shades of twilight  
If there's a reason for livin' without me  
Just let me know and I'll move on  
  
Down to the station with the big wheels burnin'  
Gonna get my ticket to play out that role which I've been given  
  
Home is where the heart is  
But at times a good home must be broken  
The wine has grown bitter  
From the harsh words we have spoken  
  
If there's a chance for someone else  
To make you feel life is worth livin'  
Give it a try oh lady  
Just let me know and I'll move on  
  
Home is where the heart is  
But at times a good home must be broken  
The wine has grown bitter  
From the harsh words we have spoken  
  
If you should need me deep in the night  
At shades of twilight  
If there's a reason for livin' without me  
Just let me know and I'll go on livin'



I've seen you suffer, you've seen me cry  
I hear your voice in my head from years gone by  
I look at your window, see the curtains move  
I feel your eyes on me, what does that prove?  
  
And I walk right past your door  
I don't know you anymore  
  
Which one was wrong, which one to blame?  
Tell me what would you gain if you win that game?  
Do what you want, do what you will  
It's not yours to choose if I love you still  
But not like I did before  
  
I don't know you anymore



I'll put your pictures all around my wall  
I'll build a tower of love that won't fall  
I'll do everything I can  
I'll try to be your own lovin' woman  
With every ounce of strength I have  
Oh, yeah  
  
Oh, there is nothing that I wouldn't do  
To let the world know  
I'm crazy 'bout you  
  
I'd use all of my woman's power  
To keep you happy for a million hours  
Every ounce of strength I have  
Every ounce of strength I have  
  
You can ask for what you want  
And a-get what you ask  
I'd give my all to make  
I would love for ever last  
With every ounce of strength I have  
Oh, yeah  
  
Long as blood runs through my veins  
Long as I can see clouds that bring on rain  
I'll use a-all of my woman's power  
To keep you happy for a million hours  
  
With every ounce of strength I have  
Every ounce of strength I have  
I'm gonna keep you happy  
With every, every, every, every ounce of strength I have  
Every ounce  
I'm gonna keep you happy  
With every, every, every



My time coming, anyday, don't worry about me, no  
Been so long I felt this way, I'm in no hurry, no  
Rainbows end down that highway where ocean breezes blow  
My time coming, voices saying they tell me where to go.  
  
Don't worry about me, nah nah nah, don't worry about me, no  
And I'm in no hurry, nah nah nah, I know where to go.  
  
California, preaching on the burning shore  
California, I'll be knocking on the golden door  
Like an angel, standing in a shaft of light  
Rising up to paradise, I know I'm gonna shine.  
  
My time coming, any day, don't worry about me, no  
It's gonna be just like they say, them voices tell me so  
Seems so long I felt this way and time sure passin' slow  
Still I know I lead the way, they tell me where I go.  
  
Don't worry about me, no no no, don't worry about me, no  
And I'm in no hurry, no no no, I know where to go.  
  
California, a prophet on the burning shore  
California, I'll be knocking on the golden door  
Like an angel, standing in a shaft of light  
Rising up to paradise, I know I'm gonna shine.  
  
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me  
Them voices tellin' me, you will soon receive me  
Standin' on the beach, the sea will part before me  
Fire wheel burning in the air!  
  
You will follow me and we will ride to glory, way up, the middle of  
The air!  
  
And I'll call down thunder and speak the same and my word fills the  
Sky with flame  
And might and glory gonna be my name and men gonna light my way.  
  
My time coming, any day, don't worry about me, no  
It's gonna be just like they say, them voices tell me so  
Seems so long I felt this way and time sure passin' slow  
My time coming, any day, don't worry about me, no  
  
Don't worry about me, no no no, don't worry about me, no  
And I'm in no hurry, no no no, don't worry about me, no.



I just opened up my eyes  
And let the world come climbing in  
It's all better now, things are gonna work somehow  
If I just sleep another hour  
Tried to reach you at your mom's  
Hey baby why you trying to keep away for so long  
I stopped feeling good, somehow I just knew I would  
I guess I'll sleep another hour  
Feels like I'm wasting my time  
Hanging on this same old line  
Got to get you off of my mind  
There's nothing left for me to find  
  
And all the more I want  
All the more I need  
All the while you want something more  
All the more I want  
All the more I need  
All the while you want something more  
  
Thought I found the words to say  
Just to get you feeling fine over heels my way  
But it don't matter how  
I lost the word and nerve and now  
There's nothing more for me to say  
Feels like I'm wasting my time  
Hanging on this same old line  
There's nothing left for me to find  
  
And all the more I want  
All the more I need  
All the while you want something more  
All the more I want  
All the more I need  
All the while you want something  
  
There's nothing left for me to say  
Wanting what I need this way  
And when I'm feeling low I know  
I need to stop  
  
And someday you will see  
All the more you want  
All the more you'll need me  
All the while I'll be on to something more  
And all the more you want  
All the more you'll need me  
All the while I want something more  
I want something more  
I want something more than this



Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you  
You have made me what I am and I am yours  
My love, there's so many ways I want to say I love you  
Let me hold you in my arms forever more  
  
You have gone and made me such a fool  
I'm so lost in your love  
And oh, we belong together  
Won't you believe in my song  
  
Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you  
You have come into my life and made me whole  
Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning  
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear  
  
In my eyes I see no one else but you  
There's no other love like our love  
And yes, oh yes, I'll always want you near me  
I've waited for you for so long  
  
Lady, your love's the only love I need  
And beside me is where I want you to be  
'Cause, my love, there's somethin' I want you to know  
You're the love of my life, you're my lady



Take, if you want a slice  
If you want a piece  
If it feels alright  
  
Break, if you like the sound  
If it gets you up  
If it brings you down  
  
Share, if it makes you sleep  
If it sets you free  
If it helps to breath  
  
Don't come over here  
And piss on my gate  
Save it just keep it  
Off my wave  
  
Cry, if you want to cry  
If it helps you see  
If it clears your eyes  
  
Hate, if you want to hate  
If it keeps you safe  
It it makes you brave  
  
Pray, if you want to pray  
If you like to kneel  
If you like to lay  
  
Don't come over here  
And piss on my gate  
Save it just keep it  
Off my wave  
  
Keep it off my wave  
Keep it off my wave  
Keep it off my wave  
  
My wave  
  
Cry, if you want to cry  
If it helps you see  
If it clears your eyes  
  
Hate, if you want to hate  
If it keeps you safe  
It it makes you brave  
  
Take, if you want a slice  
If you want a piece  
If it feels alright  
  
Don't come over here  
And piss on my gate  
Save it just keep it  
Off my wave  
  
Keep it off my wave  
Keep it off my wave  
  
My wave



Sometimes it's not that time  
For things I cannot hear  
For words I cannot feel  
The way you want to go  
It makes me feel like shit  
I'm messed but that's not it  
I wonder if she'll care  
For me ever again  
Waiting for the last time  
I'm waiting for the right time  
To see if she will know the things  
She doesn't say to me  
  
And I feel the way I feel  
Because I need you all the time  
And I know the things you know  
But that's just not enough to make it mine  
And I won't do anything that it might  
Compromise this time  
So I'll just sit and hold my breath  
Only that's not enough to make you mine  
  
Get up it's time to die  
Just guess and don't ask why  
Be late and just don't try  
Someday we will fly  
Higher than the satellites  
Into a spacial paradise  
Where up is up and down is down  
And no one is around  
(I don't want to see you crying)  
(Let's leave)  
(The dramatics behind)  
  
And I feel the way I feel  
Because I need you all the time  
And I know the things you know  
But that's just not enough to make it mine  
And I won't do anything that it might  
Compromise this time  
So I'll just sit and hold my breath  
Only that's not enough to make you mine  
  
To make you mine  
To make you mine



Bad news, bad news!  
I heard you're packing to leave  
I come a-running right over  
I just couldn't believe it  
I just couldn't believe it  
Oh, baby, baby  
You must be out of your mind  
Do you know what you're kicking away?  
We've got a groovy thing goin', baby  
We've got a groovy thing  
I never done you no wrong  
I never hit you when you're down  
I always gave you good loving  
I never ran around  
I never ran around  
Oh, baby, baby  
You must be out of your mind  
Do you know what you're kicking away?  
We've got a groovy thing goin', baby  
We've got a groovy thing  
There's something you ought to know  
If you're fixing to go  
I can't make it without you  
No no no no, no no  
No no, no no no no no  
Oh, baby, baby  
You must be out of your mind  
Do you know what you're kicking away?  
We've got a groovy thing goin', baby  
We've got a groovy thing  
We've got a groovy thing goin', baby  
We've got a groovy thing



Son you make me feel so proud I pop the buttons off my shirt  
I know I said I'd take you to the lake today  
But I'm going to have to break those plans, and it really hurts  
Every time I go fishin' it'd always start me wishin'  
That I could be a child again  
Take my 50 cents and go down to the local picture show  
To watch my heroes rope and ride  
Most times they'd win but when they'd lose it always made me cry  
Ain't nothing quite as sad as watching your heroes die  
One by one as they fall soon there'll be no heroes at all  
  
Well I guess the fish just ain't bitin' just as well I don't feel like
fightin'  
All in all it just ain't that great a fishin' day that old newspaper headline  
Kind of wrapped around this old heart of mine another big one got away  
And I can't count the times he's made me laugh  
But this time he's made me cry  
There ain't nothing quite as sad as watching your heroes die  
One by one as they fall soon there'll be no heroes at all



At an antique desk  
An old man sits alone  
It's Christmas Eve  
And it's almost time to go  
  
He signs his name to a letter he just wrote  
Then he reads it back with a voice as soft as snow  
  
[Chorus]  
I want peace on earth for Christmas  
In a world where there's not one hungry child  
They would hope and faith  
Conquers fear and hate  
All I'm asking for is a little more love  
  
Then he walks outside  
And he climbs up on his sleigh  
And calls out to his reindeer  
Off they fly away  
Oh tonight he'll make a million dreams appear  
While he wishes that his own dreams would come true this year  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That they would hope and faith  
Conquers fear and hate  
All I'm asking for is a little more love



Fog's rollin' in off the East River bank  
Like a shroud it covers Bleeker Street  
Fills the alleys where men sleep  
Hides the shepherd from the sheep  
  
Voices leaking from a sad cafe  
Smiling faces try to understand  
I saw a shadow touch a shadow's hand  
On Bleeker Street  
  
A poet reads his crooked rhyme  
Holy, holy is his sacrament  
Thirty dollars pays your rent  
On Bleeker Street  
  
I head a church bell softly chime  
In a melody sustainin'  
It's a long road to Caanan  
On Bleeker Street  
Bleeker Street



I've been working all day  
I've been shaking it loose  
It's been raining for hours  
I've been spilling my juice  
Nothing means nothing  
I couldn't care less  
And now that you're gone,  
I can't even guess  
I've got snakes in my cellar  
I've got blood in my bed  
Bombs in the closet  
They're all painted cherry red  
And a feel like a mad scientist  
I've got loose change in my head  
Nothing but trouble these days  
I eat bullets in my bread  
  
Now that you're gone  
I'm sober every night  
I can't get high - no -  
I can't get right  
  
Violent romantic  
On a seven day binge  
Losin' a gamble  
But I get my revenge  
Start thinking about thunder  
And I get mad again  
Soaking up electricity  
Like bourbon and gin  
  
Now that you're gone  
I'm sober every night  
I can't get high - no -  
I can't get right  
  
Hallucinated green light  
And I slammed on the gas  
My performance ain't perfect  
But it's loud and it's fast  
Set sail for the new world  
And I burned down the mast  
Well, it wasn't the first time  
And I know it won't be the last  
  
Now that you're gone, honey,  
I'm sober every night  
I can't get high - no -  
I can't - get - right  
Get right  
  



Babe, I'm gettin' the message it's finally comin' through  
After the show I'll get a hold of you  
Baby, I've got your number and I remember your name  
And I've got a feelin' I know why you came  
  
[Chorus]  
So let's get in some good trouble tonight  
Get ourselves in deep  
We can stay awake and dance all night  
We can always sleep  
Don't let them tell you it's a mortal sin  
'Cause I know it's alright  
And if your mama asks you where you've been  
You've been in some good trouble all night  
  
I'll be here again next year, and there you'll be again  
And I'll barely know half the places I've been  
But I can almost remember, so it was almost real  
I never know how I'm going to feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Good trouble all night  
Good trouble's all right



When I think back on these times  
And the dreams we left behind  
I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed to get to have you in my life  
  
When I look back on these days  
I'll look and see your face  
You were right there for me  
  
In my dreams I'll always see you soaring by the sky  
In my heart there'll always be a place for you  
For all my life  
I'll keep a part of you with me  
And everywhere I am there you'll be  
And everywhere I am there you'll be  
  
Well you showed me how it feels  
To feel the sky within my reach  
And I always will remember all the strength you gave to me  
Your love made me make it through  
Oh I owe so much to you  
You were right there for me  
  
In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky  
In my heart there'll always be a place for you  
For all my life  
I'll keep a part of you with me  
And everywhere I am there you'll be  
  
'Cause I always saw in you my light, my strength  
And I want to thank you now for all the ways  
You were right there for me  
(You were right there for me)  
You were right there for me  
For always  
  
In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky  
In my heart there'll always be a place for you  
For all my life  
  
I'll keep a part of you with me  
And everywhere I am there you'll be  
And everywhere I am there you'll be  
There you'll be



[Chorus]  
Hey Willy your mother calls you Billy  
Your father calls you silly  
But you really are a pretty one  
  
Hey baby you're dressing like a lady  
The fellows call you Sadie  
But you really are a pretty one  
  
You don't care  
What they say about your hair  
Cause the bad man's smiling  
Every time he sees you comin' yeah  
  
Willy is the singer in a rock'n'roll band  
Every time he shows his face  
Put away your  
  
Oh yeah Willy's gonna show them now  
No no no no Willy's gonna go somehow  
  
My name's Willy gonna turn on the lights  
Playing rock'n'roll music to early early night  
Can't stop dancing to the rhythm in your feet  
Listen to the drummer Yeah listen to the beat  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey baby you're dressing like a lady  
The fellows call you Sadie  
But you really are a pretty one  
  
You don't care  
What they say about your hair  
Cause the bad man's smiling  
Every time he sees you comin' yeah  
  
[Chorus]



With a voice, you could hear all the way to the rocky top  
Play by play for thirty-one years it never stopped  
We heard 20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see  
Touchdown Tennessee  
  
Quarterback rolled right, it was a long throw down field to willie Gault For a  
Second no one knew if it was caught  
We heard 20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see  
Touchdown Tennessee  
  
Your voice painted us a picture of all the losses and the wins  
And it's so hard to imagine a game without your voice again  
Saying 20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see  
Touchdown Tennessee  
  
So thank you John what a run it's been fun for us all  
All the way are hearts pounded when you called  
20, 15, 10, and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see  
Touchdown Tennessee  
  
So thank you John



Today is the day  
For dancing and for singing  
The birds in the trees and all  
The bells are ringing  
The sun is in the sky  
Is bright as bright second light  
Is bright oh god I hope I'm alright  
  
Cause I'm gonna cry  
Hold on, hold on  
Slow down, slow down  
You're out of touch  
Out of touch  
'Cause there is no design for life  
There's no devil's haircut in my mind  
There is not a wonder wall to climb  
To climb or step around  
But there is a slide show and it's so slow  
Flashing through my mind  
  
Today was the day  
But only for the first time  
Hold on, hold on  
Slow down, slow down  
You're out of touch  
Out of touch  
  
'Cause there is no design for life  
There is no devil's haircut in your mind  
There is not a wonder wall  
To climb or step around  
But there is a sideshow and it's so slow  
Flashing through my mind  
  
Today was the day  
But only for the first time  
I hope it's not the last time

Rolled around on kitchen floors  
Tied my tongue in pretty bows with yours  
And now we pass and just like glass  
I see through you, you see through me like I'm not there  
  
You could make my head swerve  
Used to know my every curve  
And now we meet on a street,  
And I am blind, I can not find the heart I gave to you  
  
Sometimes what we think we really want we don't  
Sometimes what we think we want we really don't  
Sometimes what we think we love we don't  
  
And I am blind. I can not find the heart I gave to you  
And when we meet on a street,  
Then I am blind, I can not find the heart I gave to you



I'm a dreamin' man, yes, that's my problem  
I can't tell when I'm not being real.  
In the meadow dusk I park my Aerostar  
With a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you.  
  
I'll always be a dreamin' man  
I don't have to understand  
I know it's alright.  
  
I see your curves and I feel your vibrations  
You dressed in black and white, you lost in the mall  
I watch you disappear past Club Med Vacations  
Another sleepless night, a sun that won't fall.  
  
I'll always be a dreamin' man  
I don't have to understand  
I know it's alright.  
  
Now the night is gone, a new day is dawning  
And our homeless dreams go back to the street  
Another time or place, another civilization  
Would really make this life feel so complete.  
  
I'll always be a dreamin' man  
I don't have to understand  
I know it's alright.  
  
Dreamin' man  
He's got a problem  
Dreamin' man  
Dreamin' man  
He's got a problem  
Dreamin' man.



We've got nothing left to lose but limousines and attitudes  
Yeah, we're banking on us baby it's crazy  
We've got nothing left to make but icing on this little cake  
Fashion sense and vanity consume us cause we  
  
We want that Kandy Life  
For me I'd like that Kandy Life  
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life  
I know our style might be abridged  
But we are the ones, bitch  
  
We got sour grapes to fry to limit this credit card life  
We're banking on hits baby it's crazy  
We've got nothing left to lose but reservations and good booze  
Copy me celebrities consume us cause we  
  
We want that Kandy Life  
For me I'd like that Kandy Life  
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life  
I know our style might be abridged  
But we are the ones, bitch  
  
I say change your pants and meet me in the  
Bathroom for a private tour and dance  
We'll share our candy, I'm not your buddy  
Baby vanity's for me, copy me cause we  
  
We want that Kandy Life  
For me I'd like that Kandy Life  
Could we get a taste of that Kandy Life  
I know our style might be abridged  
But we are the ones, bitch



Eleven times I been busted, eleven times I been to jail  
Some of the times I been there nobody could go my bail  
Well it seems to me, lord that this ol' boy just don't fit  
Well I can jump in a rosebush and come out smelling like sh...

With a temper as hot as fire  
Spent ninety days on a peat farm just doin' the county's time  
Well now, even mama said son you're bad news  
And it won't be too long before someone puts one through you

There's a sky in the east  
Over pyramids at Giza  
Where there once lived a girl  
She ruled the world  
Then down the nile  
He came with a smile  
He was the king  
She was the queen  
Under the moonlight  
Your eyes won't believe  
What your mind can't concieve  
  
Oooh  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt  
Incense and myrrh  
And girls that swirl  
To the music  
Nights over Egypt  
  
Women fellahin  
Wear veils to been seen  
By no one  
Take a caravan across  
The sudan  
Saharan fagade  
Is just a mirage  
Oasis in the sand  
Where life once began  
Under the moonlight  
Your eyes won't believe  
What your mind can't concieve  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt



When I was born, the doc he held me by my ankles  
Smacked my red behind.  
They hosed me down, wrapped me like a bean burrito  
Then marked the date and time.  
  
Hats off, to the ones that string the beads together  
And keep the ducks in line.  
Hats off to all the ones that stood before me  
And taught a fool to rhyme.  
  
At thirteen, I made myself a motion picture  
Out of lumps of clay.  
At fourteen, I pulled some weeds and bought a four string  
Taught myself to play.  
At seventeen, I'd get naked with a beauty queen  
At the hot tub zone.  
At nineteen, she was livin' hard and snortin' drugs  
That decayed her bones.  
  
Hats off to the ones that put it all together  
And keep their ducks in line.  
Hats off to all the ones that erred before me  
And taught me how to survive.



Midnight falls on the snow-lit trees  
And as I stand inside I know that I  
Can't watch life through a window  
My indecision is blocking the door  
It's like a religion  
That I never ask for more  
I might stumble and fall  
  
What's someone like me,  
Doing in a life like this?  
I can't see  
What someone like me  
Is doing in a life like this  
Slipping back into the past  
  
Sun comes up and streams  
Through the blinds  
And as I throw my clothes on  
Do my hair wrong,  
Stare into my mirror  
Telling myself that everyone falls  
Take the first step  
That's the trick of it all  
Bounce back like a ball  
  
What's someone like me  
Doing in a life like this ?...  
  
My mind is filled with  
Runaway dreams  
I can't wake up  
I don't know what it means  
You see I fell asleep  
With the television on  
When I woke up it was gone  
I read my horoscope  
To see what's in store  
I get a little lazy but  
I want more, I want more  
  
What's someone like me  
Doing in a life like this ?  
I can't see  
What someone like me  
Is doing in a life like this...



Babe, how can you mend a broken heart?  
Oh, you're tearing me apart  
Thousand drums play in my mind  
Take, it off him put it on me  
Oh, I'm feeling so lonely  
And I'm holding back my tears  
  
I don't want to a doctor for my heart  
Oh, I want to try a brand new start  
I don't want to a doctor for my heart  
Oh, I want to a commander of my love  
  
I don't want to a doctor for my lonely heartache  
My heart bleeds love me lady  
Come, take a chance on love  
  
I can give you anything but love  
Take this chains from your heart  
Thousand drums are playing my mind  
Babe, harder I try, bluer I get  
Don't put my love in a dirty bag  
Until then there's no end



I'm a long long way from home  
Mendin' a broken heart  
Runnin' away from a love gone wrong  
Tryin' to make a new start  
An old friend called me up to say  
That you've made some wedding plans  
I'm comin' home on that midnight train  
And fight for you like a man  
  
[Chorus]  
Midnight train make your whistle blow  
Engineer pour your load of coal  
Midnight train make your engine whine  
Midnight train get me home on time  
  
Oh the thought of another man holdin' you  
Is drivin' me insane  
My only chance is to ride all night  
I can't let you change your name  
Now hey conductor we can't be late  
Rollin' on down the track  
'Cause you know tomorrow's your wedding day  
I gotta win my baby back  
  
[Chorus: x2]



Written by The Doors  
  
Well, she's fashionably lean  
Hey and she's fashionably late  
She'll never gonna wreck a scene  
She'll never break a date  
But now she's no drag  
Just watch the way that she walks  
  
She's a twentieth century fox  
She's a twentieth century fox  
She's got world, she's got the world  
All locked up inside a plastic box  
She's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah  
  
She's the queen of cool  
And she's the lady who waits  
Sent to manless school  
She never gonna hesitate  
Well know she don't waste her time  
On all this elementary talk  
  
She's a twentieth century fox  
She's a twentieth century fox  
She got the world, babe,  
Now she got this world  
She got it all locked up  
Inside some kind of plastic plastic box  
She's a Twentieth century fox, oh yeah  
She's a Twentieth century fox, oh yeah  
She's a Twentieth century fox, oh yeah  
She's a Twentieth century fox



Too many problems, oh why am I here?  
I need to be me, 'cause you're all to clear  
And I can see there's something wrong with you  
Oh, what do you expect me to do?  
At least I gotta know what I want to be  
Don't come to me if you need pity  
Are you lonely, you got no-one  
You got your body in suspension  
That's a problem, problem, problem  
The problem is you  
Eat your heart out on a plastic tray  
You don't do what you want and you fade away  
You work for me, you're working nine-to-five  
It's too much fun of being alive  
I'm using my feet for my human machine  
You work for me, living for the screen  
Are you lonely, all needs catered  
You got your brains dehydrated  
  
Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you  
Oh what what you gonna do, problem, problem  
Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you  
Well, what you gonna do with your problem  
The problem is you, problem  
  
I ain't death trip, but I ain't automatic  
You work for me, just stay ecstatic  
Don't you give me any orders  
To people like me, there is no order  
  
Bet you thought you had it all worked out  
Bet you thought you knew what I was about  
Bet you thought you'd solved all your problems  
But you are the problem  
  
Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you  
Oh, what you gonna do with your problem?  
I'll leave it up to you, oh problem  
The problem is you, you got a problem  
Oh what you gonna do?  
They know a doctor, gonna take you away  
They take you away and they throw away the key  
They don't want you and they don't want me  
You got a problem the problem is you  
Problem, well, what you gonna do?  
Problem, have you got a problem?  
Problem, well you got a problem  
  
[Repeat: x17]  
Problem



Ooh, it's over, it's over, ooh, hey  
Oh, baby, it's over, it's over baby  
  
I want you the right way  
And I want you, but I want you to want me too  
Want you to want me baby  
Just like I want you, ooh  
  
I'll give you all the love I want in return, sweet darling  
But half a love is all I feel  
Ooh, it's too bad, just too sad you don't want me now  
But I'm gonna change your mind somehow, oh baby  
  
I want you the right way  
I want you, but I want you to want me too  
I want you to want me baby  
Just like I want you, oh  
  
One way love is just a fantasy, oh sugar  
To share is precious, pure and fair, oh  
Don't play with something you should cherish for life, oh baby  
Oh, don't you wanna care? It's lonely out there  
  
Oh, I want you the right way  
I want you, babe, but I want you to want me too  
Oh, I want to get down baby  
When I, when I get down with you, yeah  
  
I want you the right way  
I want you, babe, but I want you to want me too  
I want you baby  
Just like I want you, oh  
  
Get down babe, have mercy darling  
Listen darling, I love you, I love you  
And I want you babe, to get down babe  
When I get down with you, oh  
  
I want you babe, I want you babe  
I want you, but I want you to want me too, oh  
Oh, I love you, hey, just like I want you  
Oh, you gotta get down baby

Back in the mother fuckin saddle  
My six shooter strapped and I'm lookin for a battle  
Out on the plains I'm just a loner  
My saddle horn rubs right and yo it's givin me a boner  
  
I got thoughts of Annie Oakley  
But that buck toothed tramp in that last town she broke me  
And we didn't even fuck  
I gave my last gold tooth 'n gold nugget to get my dick sucked  
  
3 days out on the frontier  
And I'd kill for a cheap whore and a barrel of cold beer  
I need a slut for a service  
I take a peak at the shiip and they all run away nervous  
  
Man I gotta get my rocks off  
'cause my Wranglers don't fit right unless my cock's soft  
Long nights by the fire me a Trigger.....go figure  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a desperate rado  
Didn't take any practice  
A desperate rado  
  
Got a cock like a cactus  
Now I drift through the desert like a wild coyote  
Horny as a toad trippin off peyote  
Holdin uptrains and gettin goods by the sack  
  
I'm known through out the west as the pie eyed mack  
And to the law I'm no stranger  
I'm wanted dead or alive 'cause I shot the Lone Ranger  
And then Tonto tried to get down  
  
So I boned his bitch slit he's throat and then I skipped town  
That's the way I run my show  
Paint towns red  
Fuck hoes and then I lay low  
  
I know you think I'm archaic  
But my dick's like a sword  
I see pussy and want to slay it  
Out on the plains it gets linely  
  
Sometimes I feel homely  
New faces  
New towns no one knows me  
Guns cocked in my holster  
  
You see my face in each town nailed to a pole on a poster  
I'm always lookin for the quick buck  
Then always blowin my cash on a bitch with a big butt  
Some say my head's hollow  
  
Fuck em... I'm just a  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Desperate rado  
Trottin through the bad lands  
A desperate rado  
Tokin down with all the cowhands  
A desperate rado  
Didn't take much practice  
A desperate rado  
  
Got a cock like a cactus  
Now I fuck whores by the scores up ten fold on any fellow  
In any town I can be found at the local bordello  
Never yellow never chicken listen for my spurs draggin,  
  
And when I'm kickin dust you better circle up the wagons  
So when I rip through your town don't be gawkin  
Just tip your hat and Tex keep walkin  
'Cause I'm a gun slingin top hand  
  
Fuck with me and you'll go out like Custer at his last stand  
I'm a low down buckaroo  
If you leave me alone with your mother then I'll fuck her too  
'Cause I'm a sidewinding nomad  
  
And morals in upbringing is something that I never had  
Known as the ruff ridin Texan  
A bad buck from the day of my inception.  
And I was raised in the poor house  
  
My mother kicked me out so she could start a whore house  
Now since the day I left the corral  
I've been on a quest for the plant that's called mescal  
'Cause pale rider once pulled me aside  
And told me that high was the best way to ride...  
  
[Chorus 3]  
Now I'm a desperate rado  
Always lookin for a fight  
A desperate rado  
Puffin on a peace pipe  
I'm a desperate rado  
On the run from the law  
A desperate rado baddest one you ever saw



The sweetest smile  
The shyest kiss  
Two wounded hearts  
Were not expecting this  
CHORUS:  
Look what love's revealing  
Something to believe in  
Time to start the healing  
For you and me  
Look what love's revealing  
  
Promises for keeping  
It's natural as breathing  
Look what love's revealing  
Willing to trust  
We'll make it through  
You reach for me  
And find me reaching too  
REPEAT CHORUS  
It's natural as breathing  
Look what love's revealing  
  
  



When the jungle shadows fall  
Like the tick tick tock of the eye of the clock  
As it's standing against the wall  
Like the drip drip drip of the rain drops  
When the summer shower's through  
So a voice within me  
Keeps revealing you, you  
  
Night and day  
You are the one  
Only you beneath the moon  
And under the sun  
Whether near to me or far  
It's no matter, baby, where you are  
I think of you  
Night and day  
  
Day and night  
Why is it so  
That this longing for you follows wherever I go  
In the roaring traffic gloom  
In the silence of my lonely room  
I think of you  
Night and day  
  
Night and day  
Under the hide of me  
Though such a hungry yearning  
Burning inside of me  
This torment won't be through  
'til you let me spend my life making love to you  
Day and night  
Night and day  
  
Night and day  
Under the hide of me  
Oh, such a hungry yearning  
Burning, burning inside of me  
This torment won't be through  
'til you let me spend my life making love to you  
Day and night  
Night and day  
  
Night and day  
Night and day  
Night and day  
Night, night, night and day  
Night and day  
Night, night and day  
Night and day



Why do hearts feel the way they do  
Why does men wanna say that I love you  
Till the end of time  
Till I lose my mind  
Till it's over and left so far behind  
  
I just can't keep it all inside  
So unbelievable how much I've tried  
Yet I call for you  
I long for you  
And I say the words I wish you'd want to here  
Though you're never here  
  
Chorus:  
Our heats and though they beat as one  
But in time, the time for us will never come  
So I, I just go on  
And just remember those eyes  
That look right through my heat  
The smile that shows what's in you  
That makes me wanna cry  
Coz I know  
I'll never have you even for a while  
  
Now all is said and done it seems  
I keep remembering what I would call a dream  
Where you came true  
For a minute or two  
That was all the time it took  
To make me know you had to go  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Cause I know  
I'll never have you...  
And I know  
I'll never have you  
Even for a while...



Well, All Right  
Petty, Alison, Holly, Mauldin  
  
Well, all right so I'm being foolish  
Well, all right let people know  
About the dreams and wishes you wish  
In the night when the lights are low  
  
Well, all right, well all right  
We'll live and love with all our might  
Well, all right, well all right  
Our lifetime love will be all right  
  
Well, all right, so I'm going steady  
It's all right when people say  
That those foolish kids can't be ready  
For the love that comes their way  
  
Well, all right, well all right  
We'll live and love with all our might  
Well, all right, well all right  
Our lifetime love will be all right  
Repeat last verse



Feel like I'm livin' under some kind of hex  
Livin' in here in this industrial military complex  
Doesn't really help when I read Time magazine  
Cause they only distort the scene  
The sky is so hazy I can't even see the sun  
Livin' here is like livin' under a gun  
I really do wonder 'bout the United Nations  
Why don't they face the situations  
I'm a troubadour  
Lookin' for a dream  
I'm a troubadour  
Lookin' for some dream  
Lord, I'm so tired of payin' all of these dues  
From Sunday to Sunday all I hear is bad news  
Tired of the war and those industrial fools  
Got to make it better cause I've got nothin' to lose  
Ain't too clear to pay my income taxes  
'Specially when I know it goes to kill the masses  
Love to hear the President make it perfectly clear  
How the donkeys and the elephants are police up here  
I'm a troubadour  
Lookin for a dream  
I'm a troubadour  
Lookin for some dream  
Lord, I'm so tired of payin' all of these dues  
From Sunday to Sunday all I hear is bad news  
Tired of the war and those industrial fools  
I've got to make it better cause I've got nothin' lose  
Won't somebody help me cause I've gotten in my shoes  
Those industrial military complex blues  
  



Meet me in the middle of the day  
Let me hear you say everything's okay  
Bring me southern kisses from your room  
  
Meet me in the middle of the night  
Let me hear you say everything's alright  
Let me smell the moon in your perfume  
  
Oh, Gods and years will rise and fall  
And there's always something more  
It's lost in talk, I waste my time  
  
And it's all been said before  
  
While further down behind the masquerade the tears are there  
I don't ask for all that much I just want someone to care  
That's right now  
  
Meet me in the middle of the day  
Let me hear you say everything's okay  
Come on out beneath the shining sun  
  
Meet me in the middle of the night  
Let me hear you say everything's alright  
Sneak on out beneath the stars and run  
  
Oh yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah  
  
It's king and queen and we must go down now beyond the chandelier  
Where I won't have to speak my mind and you won't have to hear  
Shreds of news and afterthoughts and complicated scenes  
We'll huddle down behind the light and fade like magazines  
  
Meet me in the middle of the day  
Let me hear you say everything's okay  
Bring me southern kisses from your room  
  
Hey hey, meet me in the middle of the night  
Let me hear you say everything's alright  
Let me smell the moon in your perfume  
  
Oh now, meet me in the middle of the day  
Let me hear you say everything's okay  
Let me see you smiling back at me  
  
Hey, meet me in the middle of the night  
Let me hear you say everything's alright  
Hold me tight and love and loving's free  
  
Woah yeah



Turn the lights down low, I'm ready the break it off  
Since computer love, been wanting to set it off  
Like a hotel room I'm checking in to you  
Digging like shovel, all the things you do  
Take a leap over the broom, it's how you making me feel  
Come on in dis room, and let's keep it real, you know  
  
[Chorus]  
Half on a baby  
All I need is your body next to me (saying ooh)  
Ooh na na na na na (yo, yo body) Yo body na na na [Repeat: x2]  
  
Now tell me what the deal is, are u ready to bump  
It's gonna take a life time, to give u all of dis love  
So baby open up, and get ready to receive  
A miracle of love, getting down with me  
Like a baseball field, wanna hit a home run  
Me and u get together babe, and raise a lil' one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Set it off in a six, baby dat'll be cool  
Take a trip down town between me and you  
Sipping Don Perigdon  
Conversation like, what?  
Not afraid to go there, why don't u open up  
After 9 to 5, you deserve some 12  
Making future plans, to be where I dwell  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
From my toes up (From my toes up)  
To my knee cap (to my knee caps, to waistline)  
And slowly (and slowly, lady)  
Can we go half on my baby [Repeat: x2]  
  
[Chorus]



Yeah-eh-heah  
You are, my fire,  
The one, desire,  
Believe, when I say  
I want it that way  
  
But we, are two worlds apart,  
Can't reach to your heart,  
When you say,  
That I want it that way  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me why,  
Ain't nothin' but a heartache,  
Tell me why,  
Ain't nothin' but a mistake,  
Tell me why,  
I never want to hear you say,  
I want it that way  
  
Am I, your fire?  
Your one, desire,  
Yes I know, it's too late,  
But I want it that way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I can see that we've fallen apart,  
From the way that it used to be, Yeah,  
No matter the distance,  
I want you to know,  
That deep down inside of me  
  
You are, my fire,  
The one, desire,  
You are (You are, you are, you are)  
  
Don't want to hear you say,  
Ain't nothin' but a heartache,  
Ain't nothin' but a mistake,  
(Don't want to hear you say),  
I never want to hear you say,  
I want it that way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me why,  
Ain't nothin' but a heartache,  
Ain't nothin' but a mistake,  
Tell me why,  
I never want to hear you say,  
(Never want to hear you say it),  
I want it that way  
  
'Cause I want it that way



Make his fight on the hill in the early day  
Constant chill deep inside  
Shooting gun, on they run through the endless grey  
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?  
For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know  
Suffered wounds test their pride  
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow  
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know  
  
For whom the bell tolls  
Time marches on  
For whom the bell tolls  
  
Take a look to the sky just before you die  
It is the last time he will  
Blackened claw massive roar fills the crumbling sky  
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry  
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery  
He hears the silence so loud  
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be  
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see  
  
For whom the bell tolls  
Time marches on  
For whom the bell tolls

Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)  
My name is Shaaady  
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)  
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (So long)  
My name is Shaaady  
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)  
  
Yea  
  
You see that chick in the gym checkin' me out?  
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth  
I lose a pill and I'm wrecklessly wreckin' the house  
That was supposed to be breakfast where the heck is it now?  
Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse  
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out  
Nope, guess I'll re-route  
Maybe somewhere in the depths of your couch  
Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'open sesame' mouth  
Down the hatchet, the feelin' you can't match it  
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet  
I tac-tac-tacin' the whore with the damn hatchet  
I nap-sack-pack with like forty some Xanaxes  
Shorty come back, I'm tryin' to score me some lap dancers  
I'm 'bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniels  
Formula forty-four and forty's with mad capsules  
The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya  
  
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
And are you menstruating baby my little friend's waitin' to say hello  
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin' like Jell-O  
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
  
Yea  
  
My equilibrium's off, must be the Lithium  
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em  
It just becomes everyday extracurricular  
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun  
A fifth of rum and two bottles of one fifty one  
Fifty one people asleep in my damn livin' room  
'Scuse me hun, but what was your name, Vivian?  
I woke up next to you naked and uh, did we umm?  
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?  
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there doesn't seem to be one  
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm  
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from  
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run  
like Speedy Gonzales to see if I see anyone  
Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiendin' for some  
My head is poundin' to the beat of the drum  
  
Umm  
  
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?  
So I'm hopin' that some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow  
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
  
Oh, Those were the days they certainly were  
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' the curtain for good  
(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)  
I second that and a third, rush to emergency surgery  
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased  
He no longer gettin' the three hundred bucks for these Perk-idans  
Buster's gettin' to be where he lustfully surged it in  
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin' him'  
Childishly on the phone tryin' to rustle up  
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils  
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumblin' back  
Slipped and fell hit his backbone heard somethin' go crack  
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's bustin' a nap  
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact  
I'm just bustin' my own chops while I'm bustin' a rap  
Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it' I'm back  
  
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?  
So I'm hopin' that some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow  
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello  
  
So I'm sayin  
Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)  
My name is Shaaady  
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)  
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (So long)  
My name is Shaaady  
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)



I can almost hear you sigh  
I can almost hear you cry  
On every crowded street  
All the places we would meet  
  
What will I do without ya  
They say that life goes on  
I'm feeling sorry for myself  
I can't believe you're gone  
  
And you acted much too calm  
You turned on all the charm  
You had a cold look in your eyes  
  
I can feel your tongue on mine  
Silky smooth like wine  
I'm living with these memories  
That's all that's left of you and me  
  
I can almost hear you sigh  
Almost hear you cry  
When you made sweet love to me  
And you turned on all the charm  
Acted much too calm  
You had a cold look in your eyes  
  
Did it mean nothing  
Was it all in vain  
Was I just your fool  
Or was the pleasure pain  
  
Have you set me free  
Or will I wake up  
In the morning  
And find out it's been a bad dream  
  
Come on, I beg you  
I want to be your main man  
  
I can almost hear you sigh  
Almost hear you cry  
When you make sweet love to me  
Almost see your smile  
It stretched half a mile  
You had a stone cold look in your eyes



Somewhere over the rainbow  
Way up high  
There's a land that I heard of  
Once in a lullaby  
  
Somewhere over that rainbow  
Skies are blue  
And the dreams  
That you dare to dream  
Really do come true  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
Way above the chimney tops  
That's where you'll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why, oh why can't I?  
  
If happy little bluebirds fly  
Beyond the rainbow  
Why, oh why can't I?



I've played the song,  
Now it drives me crazy  
I've run the race  
Now I'm too damn lazy  
This love of ours  
Is a fading photograph yeah yeah  
Now I must approach to life today,  
Seems a little different,  
Hard to say,  
But it looks like the end.  
  
Time's up  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we slam the door shut  
Didn't you know if nothing  
Changes nothing changes.  
Time's up  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we turn the lights off  
Love is a train we wait for it  
Even when it's gone.  
  
We've surfed the wave  
Now we've hit the short end  
We've squeezed the fruit  
Till there's no more juice left.  
We're both so good  
Good at keeping up the lie yeah yeah  
Hey but no one's got to die  
We can get it in prospective,  
Kiss my lips  
Life is what we make it.  
  
Time's up  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we slam the door shut  
Didn't you know if nothing  
Changes nothing changes.  
Time's up,  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we turn the lights off  
Love is a train we wait for it  
Even when it's gone.  
  
As I'm waving you goodbye  
I want you to smile  
Save a picture in your frame  
File it right next to my name  
I'm willing to die  
For love willing to try  
But not willing to lie for love  
I know that this cakes already baked  
Now it's burning burning.  
  
We can get it in prospective,  
Kiss my lips  
Life is what we make it  
  
Time's up  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we slam the door shut,  
Didn't you know if nothing  
Changes nothing changes.  
Times up,  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Better we turn the lights off  
Love is a train we wait for it yeah yeah  
Even when it's gone.  
Time's up,  
Promise this time I get enough,  
Promise this time I'll get it off  
Love is a train we wait for it  
Even when it's gone



Living for you is easy living  
It's easy to live when you're in love  
And I'm so in love  
There is nothing in life but you  
  
I never regret the years I'm giving  
They're easy to give when you're in love  
I'm happy to do whatever I do for you  
  
For you maybe I'm a fool  
But it's fun  
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand  
Darling, it's grand  
They just don't understand  
  
Living for you is easy living  
It's easy to live when you're in love  
And I'm so in love  
There's nothing in life but you



I know your insides are feeling so hollow  
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah  
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover  
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same  
  
I really wanna love somebody  
I really wanna dance the night away  
I know we're only half way there  
But you can take me all the way, if you take me all the way  
I really wanna touch somebody  
I think about you every single day  
I know we're only half way there  
But you can take me all the way, you can take me all the way  
  
You're such a hard act for me to follow  
Love me today don't leave me tomorrow, yeah  
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover  
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same  
  
I really wanna love somebody  
I really wanna dance the night away  
I know we're only half way there  
But take me all the way, if you can take me all the way  
I really wanna touch somebody  
I think about you every single day  
I know we're only half way there  
But you can take me all the way, if you can take me all the way  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh  
  
I don't know where to start, I'm just a little lost  
I wanna feel like we're never gonna ever stop  
I don't know what to do, I'm right in front of you  
Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah  
  
I really wanna love somebody  
I really wanna dance the night away  
I know we're only half way there  
But take me all the way, if you can take me all the way  
I really wanna touch somebody  
I think about you every single day  
I know we're only half way there  
But take me all the way, if you can take me all the way  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh  
  
Take me all the way, if you take me all the way yeah



[Intro:]  
Xanadu  
Xanadu  
  
Love isn't easy when it's too far away  
You need a lot of faith and dedication  
I don't have that problem, I see you everyday  
An hour filled with hope and inspiration...  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
Xanadu, I've been waiting my whole life  
For a chance to meet a girl just like you  
And I believe it's gonna be you and me  
If you will get to know me too...  
  
I love all about you, but you don't know who I am  
Sure is a complicated situation  
So what if I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming I am your man  
And we wake up in a real life conversation...  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
I feel in love with a girl on tv  
She captivates me On reality tv  
  
She's looking at me but she cannot see me.  
I hope she will be more than a fantasy....  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
I fell in love with a girl on tv  
She captivates me On reality tvbosson Lyrics Index



Broken windows and empty hallways  
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's going to rain today  
  
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles  
With frozen smiles to chase love away  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's going to rain today  
  
Lonely, lonely  
Tin can at my feet  
Think I'll kick it down the street  
That's the way to treat a friend  
  
Bright before me the signs implore me  
To help the needy and show them the way  
Human kindness is overflowing  
And I think it's going to rain today



I was just a little girl  
Skinny legs, a press and curl  
My mother always thought I'd be a star  
But way before my record deal,  
The streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill  
Made sure that I'd never go too far  
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been  
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem  
Story starts at Hootaville grew up next to Ivy Hill  
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun  
"Kill the guy" in Carter park  
Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark  
Watching kids show off the stolen ones  
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been  
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem  
  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back,  
Looking back, looking back, looking back  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back  
  
A bag of Bontons, twenty cents and a nickel  
Springfield Ave. had the best popsicles  
Saturday morning cartoons and Kung-Fu  
Main street roots tonic with the dreds  
A beef patty and some coco bread  
Move the patch from my Lees to the tongue of my shoe  
'Member Frelng-Huysen used to have the bomb leather  
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick were together  
Looking at the crew, we thought we'd all live forever  
  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back  
  
Drill teams on Munn street  
Remember when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef  
Moving Records was on Central Ave.  
I was there at dancing school  
South Orange Ave. at Borlin pool  
Unaware of what we didn't have  
Writing your friends' names on your jeans with a marker  
  
July 4th races off of Parker  
Fireworks at Martin stadium  
The Untouchable P.S.P., where all them crazy niggers be  
And car thieves got away through Irvington  
Hillside brings beef with the cops  
Self-Destruction record drops  
And everybody's name was Muslim  
Sensations and '88 attracted kids from out-of-state  
And everybody used to do the wop  
Jack, Jack, Jack ya body  
Nah, the Biz Mark used to amp up the party  
I wish those days, they didn't stop  
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been  
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem  
  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back  
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got  
Looking back  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back  
  
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back



There's a ring around the moon tonight and a chill in the air  
And a fire in the stars that hang so near, so near  
There's a sound in the wind that blows through the wild mountain holds  
Like the sighs of a thousand crying souls, crying souls  
There's a time when the traveler is fated to find  
That insight has turned his gaze behind, behind  
And the steps taken yesterday will beckon again  
And lead to his weary journey's end, his journey's end  
And in the passage from the cradle to the grave we are born, madly dancing  
Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
I cast my fate with the wife of Lot I turned my gaze around  
Knowing neither what I sought nor what was to be found  
Heeding weakness, feeding strength, oh life at length is frail  
I seek again the river's source through time's dark shadowed veil  
In the fast fading century, as we spin through the years  
I pray that our failing vision clears, our vision clears  
And in the passage from the cradle to the grave we are born, madly dancing  
Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
The places dash and the faces dart like fishes in a dream  
Hiding 'neath the murky banks of long forgotten streams  
The lines of life are never long when seen from end to end  
The future's never coming, and the past has never been  
There's a ring around the moon tonight, and a chill in the air  
And a fire in the stars that hang so near, so near  



  
Blink and you miss a beat  
  
Keep one of your eyes open at all times  
Think that you're on the brink?  
The shit hasn't even begun to hit the fan  
Consequence you'll see will be stranger than a gang of drunken mimes  
Situation has a stink  
Better clear the air before your son becomes a man  
  
Blink  
  
Everything's been augmented  
You've been left so far behind  
Think, for sure, next time you should wear a pair of eyes in the back of your  
head  
Consequence you've seen has been stranger than sci-fi of any kind  
Situation baffles me  
I guess it's true you are too one of the walking dead  
  
You better think fast!  
?Cause you never know what's comin' around the bend  
You better not blink!  
For consequence is a bigger word than you think  
It's bigger than you and me  



Standing in a queue of a school canteen  
Guys on the corner they were laughin' at me  
But I don't mind if they see it all  
You know I gotta come clean  
I gotta come clean  
I got a crush on you  
  
My mind don't need it but my body do  
A little bit of loving and attention for you  
Although we're only strangers  
They don't need to know  
I gotta cum clean, I gotta cum clean  
Ooh, I got a crush on you  
  
I want to get serious right away  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
What you doin' today or any other day?  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
Just one look and I go insane  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
  
Your daddy never comes to get you  
Cause lives so far away  
But his I-talian chauffeur shows up every day  
But I'll get you in the corner, I'll get you all  
alone  
I gotta cum clean, I gotta come clean  
  
I got a crush on you  
  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
One-two, I got a crush on you  
I said one-two  
I got a crush on you  
  
Why should I get a crush on yet?



What is this song all about?  
Can't figure any lyrics out  
How do the words to it go?  
I wish you'd tell me, I don't know  
Don't know, don't know, don't know, oh no  
Dnn't know, don't know, don't know  
  
Now I'm mumblin' and I'm screamin'  
And I don't know what I'm singin'  
Crank the volume, ears are bleedin'  
I still don't know what I'm singin'  
We're so loud and incoherent  
Boy this oughtta bug your parents  
Yeah  
  
It's un-in-tel-ligible  
I just can't get it through my skull  
It's hard to bargle nawdle zouss(?)  
With all these marbles in my mouth  
Don't know, don't know, don't know, oh no  
Don't know, don't know, don't know...  
  
Well we don't sound like Madonna  
Here we are now, we're Nirvana  
Sing distinctly? We don't wanna  
Buy our album, we're Nirvana  
A garage band from Seattle  
Well, it sure beats raising cattle  
Yeah  
  
And I forgot the next verse  
Oh well, I guess it pays to rehearse  
The lyric sheet's so hard to find  
What are the words? Oh, nevermind  
Don't know, don't know, don't know, oh no  
Don't know, don't know don't know...  
  
Well, I'm yellin' and we're playin'  
But I don't know what I'm sayin'  
What's the message I'm conveyin'?  
Can you tell me what I'm sayin'?  
So have you got some idea?  
Didn't think so, well, I'll see ya!  
Sayonara, sayonara  
Ayonawa, adinawa  
Odinaya, yodinaya  
Yaddayadda, yaaahyaaah  
Ayaaaaah!  



Funny how secrets travel  
I'd start to believe if I were to bleed  
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high  
Cruise me blond  
Cruise me babe  
A blond belief beyond beyond beyond  
No return No return  
I'm deranged  
Deranged my love  
I'm deranged down down down  
So cruise me babe cruise me baby  
CHORUS  
And the rain sets in  
It's the angel-man  
I'm deranged  
Cruise me cruise me cruise me babe  
The clutch of life and the fist of love  
Over your head  
Big deal Salaam  
Be real deranged Salaam  
Before we reel  
I'm deranged  
CHORUS (two times)  
Cruise me cruise me cruise me babe  



Yeah yeah!  
Don't look now, but here come the eightees!  
  
I was so cool back in sixty-five  
I had it made 'cause I understood what to do to survive  
I had my car, and I made the scene  
Didn't give a damn about no gasoline  
They can go to hell  
My friend we never thought about the world  
And its realities  
The promised land was ours  
We were the Great Society  
  
I'm so confused by the things I read, I need the truth  
But the truth is, I don't know who to believe  
The left say yes, and the right says no  
I'm in between and the more I learn  
Well, the less that I know  
I got to make a show  
  
Livin' high, living fine  
Livin' high on borrowed time  
  
Yes! No!  
Yes! No!  
No! Yes!

Did you ever stop to listen  
To what you're missin', in the things you say  
If you open up your eyes  
Than you'll realize, what I say  
  
You can do what you want to  
You can do if you try  
You can do what you want to  
You can do if you try  
  
You take that golden rule  
That you learned in school  
And just throw it away  
If you're well directed  
Then you're protected, from the evil ways  
  
You can do what you want to  
You can do if you try  
You can do what you want to  
You can do if you try  
  
You can do what you want to  
You can do if you try



It's baby's first Christmas,  
It's somethin' to see,  
Mommy and Daddy,  
Trimmin' baby's Christmas tree.  
Baby's big brother,  
Is busy with his toys,  
He's shinin' up the chimney,  
For Santa Claus!

And oh, what a joy,

A Christmas full of love!

Military show is blastin' off to Kosovo.  
Military show with lightning speed.  
Sensitivity? oh, just a rusty nail in the corporate show.  
How many stabs before we bleed?  
  
Those Pinocchios chattering out in stereo,  
Boy Pinocchio and his golden deed.  
Masculinity? oh, galvanized in the world wide show  
As we fertilize the seed.  
  
Power mad, I didn't chop the tree down dad  
I only try to do what's right.  
Power man, the best friend that you ever had  
Unless of course you choose to fight.  
  
Power mad, driving out of the shadows,  
He never tires when he plays.  
Power mad, he's a streak in the night time  
Speculating how he'll take on the world some day.  
  
Originality? oh, just a rusty nail in a Broadway show  
How many stabs before we succeed.  
  
Power mad, I didn't drop my pants down dad,  
I know my left hand from my right.  
Power man, the best friend that you ever had  
Unless of course you lose the fight.



Now's not the time to say goodbye  
And I'm not the kind to question why  
Well I don't feel very well, and it's getting cold as hell  
It won't be the same, can't you tell?  
  
Don't leave me alone  
Don't leave me on my own  
I'm so afraid  
Why can't you stay?  
Just don't leave me alone  
How long will my song be wrong?  
  
Doing the things I should have known  
Only to reap what I have sown  
Jesus, please  
  
Don't leave me alone  
Don't leave me on my own  
I'm on my knees  
Forgive me please  
Just don't leave me alone  
How long will my song be wrong?  
  
(keyboard solo)  
  
Don't leave me alone  
Don't leave me on my own  
I'm so afraid  
Why can't you stay?  
Just don't leave, don't leave... Me alone  
How long will my song... Be... Wrong?



Yeah!  
Slow French kissing with the Dauphin's daughter  
If I fall in love now I'll be floating in Seine  
Plastered in Paris I've had an Eiffel  
Gonna make my escape on the midnight train  
Choo, choo to you - Choo, choo to you - Charting the single  
Schnapping my fingers on an alcoholiday  
Sniff round a Fraulein when I'm scent to Cologne  
All night hotel Liebling make your mark  
Let sugar daddy melt in his home sweet home  
Home is where the heart lies, but if the heart lies  
Where is home, is where the heart lies, but where is home?  
  
Get a pizza the action when I Romeo again  
Chianti see you with me, so just let him wine  
Juliet on the balcony, it's pasta serenade  
Wedding rings, I know when Venice time, Venice time  
To chart the single, to chart the single  
  
Charting the single, charting the single  
The chicks are getting cheaper on the not so common market  
Stockpile experience before the blond hairs turn to grey  
Before the blond hairs turn to grey  
I like to train, express myself in the universal language  
Ego on my face in the nicest possible way  
It's absolutely the nicest possible way  
  
Charting the single  
I got no clause in my contract, got no shares in my name  
I'm just charting the single in a bachelor's game  
Charting the single  
It's a solo performance on a one way street  
You'll never have the chance again and never again we'll meet  
Charting, charting, charting, charting the single



[Alice]  
Don't know why I'm down here  
Must be something I said  
Or some small imperfection  
In my soul or in my head  
Don't know why I'm down here  
Don't deserve to roast or bake  
I'm fighting off slanderous allegations  
Why don't you give the kid a break?  
  
[Alice]  
Don't think maybe we could talk this over  
You're a reasonable man  
Could we discuss my grave situation  
I'm a miserable man  
And I'm in the frying pan  
Give the kid a break (continues over dialog)  
  
Devil: Give me one good reason why I should  
Alice: All right, all right, so I made a few mistakes but listen.. But for
heaven's sake  
Devil: Watch your language, Kid.  
Alice: OK, OK, don't get hot  
  
[Devil]  
Don't question my judgement  
He only reaped what he sowed  
He cast his pearls before swine  
And that's good enough for me  
  
[Devil]  
I don't want to talk it over  
Even tho' I'm a reasonable man  
Sonny, from over here looks like you're in no position to bargain  
You're a convicted man  
You're right in the frying pan  
  
Give the kid a break (continues over dialog  
  
Alice: Yeah, Please give me a break  
Devil: Nah, I don't think so, man  
Alice: Come on, you know I got what it takes. Can't you give me a break?  
Devil: Sure thing kid, when hell freezes over  
Choir: Ok, don't give the kid a break  
Alice: Hey you guys, I thought you were on my side  
Choir: No. Give the kid a break  
Alice: Yeah, well thanks a lot, pals  
Alice: Listen boss, maybe we can make a little deal. Is there anything I can
say, some kind of fine I can pay? Anything?  
  
[Alice:  
Don't know why I'm down here  
Must be something I said (I'm sorry)  
Or some small imperfection  
In my soul or in my head  
It might be some sort of imperfection  
It might be a defection or a, a clear case of misdirection yeah  
It must be a small imperfection  
In my soul or in my head  
Give the kid a break



I've got to follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bite my lip  
Gotta wreck my health  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
  
I've got to follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bite my lip  
Gotta wreck my health  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
  
I've gotta the follow money  
Gotta earn my pay  
I spent everything  
I earned yesterday  
Gotta find the cash  
Cause it won't find me  
So I can feed myself  
And my family  
  
When I left school I was bummin' around  
I'd smoke and drink and let my mind wander  
I'd roll out of bed about twelve o'clock  
I can't do that any longer  
  
I've gotta follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bite my lip  
Gotta wreck my health  
Gotta break my back  
For my share of wealth  
  
Now I need to toil 'cause it's good for my soul  
I feel clean when I'm working  
You drop all the mystical Celtic bull  
Cause that stuff's just jerking  
  
I'm not saying that I work like my dad  
I know I don't work like my mum  
But I'm made of the same stuff  
And I'm six feet tall  
Gimme the tools I'll get the job done  
  
Gotta follow the money  
Gotta go to work  
Gotta make a living  
Till my body hurts  
Gotta bit my lip

I spent everything  
I earned yesterday  
Gotta find the cash

That's why  
  
I'm working

"I've had enough and I want out!"  
"You can't walk away now."  
  
I looked back once  
And all I saw was his face  
Smiling, the needle crying  
Walking out of his room  
With mirrors, afraid I heard him scream  
You'll never get away  
  
Cold and shaking  
I crawled down alleys to try  
And scrape away the tracks that marked me  
Slammed my face into walls of concrete  
I stared, amazed at the words written on the wall  
  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries  
Cries your name  
  
Wet and raving  
The needle keeps calling me back  
To bloody my hands forever  
Carved my cure with the blade  
That left me in scars  
Now every time I'm weak  
Words scream from my arm  
  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries,  
Cries your name  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries,  
Cries your name



I'm tired to be losed,  
Actions speaks louder then words,  
If you feel me,  
Run away where you will be,  
Have more limit to be free,  
You release me...  
  
Take me away,  
Take me away,  
Take me away (Ooh),  
Take me away  
  
I'm tired to be losed,  
Actions speaks louder then words,  
If you feel me,  
Run away where you will be,  
Have more limit to be free,  
You release me...  
  
Take me away,  
Take me away,  
Take me away (Ooh),  
Take me away



(Rodney Crowell)  
You looked for trouble and you found it son  
Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun  
You'd try to run but you don't think you can  
You make one move and you're dead man, friend  
I ain't living long like this  
I can't live at all like this, can I baby  
He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back  
Then he left me freezing on a steel rail track  
They got 'em all in the jailhouse, ain't they bay  
I ain't living long like this  
Grew up in Houston off of Wayside drive  
Son of a charhop in some all night dive  
Dad drove a stock car to an early death  
All I remember was a drunk man's death  
I ain't living long like this  
I can't live at all like this can I baby  
We know the story how the wheel goes round  
Don't let 'em take you to the man downtown  
Can't sleep at all in the jailhouse, baby  
I ain't living long like this  
You live for angel, she's a roadhouse queen  
Make Texas ruby look like Sandra Dee  
You want to love her but you don't know how  
You're at the bottom of the jailhouse now  
I ain't living long like this  
I can't live at all like this, can I baby  
You know the story 'bout the jailhouse rock  
Go on and do it, but just don't get caught  
They got 'em all in the jailhouse, ain't they baby  
I ain't living long like this  



Uhhh!  
I can't help my feelings  
I'll go out of my mind  
These playas out to get me  
'Cause they like my behind  
I can't love my business  
If I can't get a trick  
Down on Santa Monica where tricks aren't for kids  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoa,  
C'mon and kick me  
Whoa,  
C'mon and kick me  
(Whoa-oh-oh)  
C'mon and kick me-e-e  
(Whoa-oh-oh)  
You got your problems  
(Whoa-oh-oh)  
I got my eyes wide  
(Whoa-oh-oh)  
You got your big G's  
I got my hash pipe  
  
Uhhh!  
I can't help my bookies  
They get out of control  
I know that you don't care  
But I want you to know  
The least likely flavor is from the favorite treat  
Abandon the bottle for the taste of her teat  
  
[Chorus: x2]



Whoah!  
  
Grab a drink  
Come with me, yeah we're stepping out  
Gonna rage, gonna riot 'til we're passing out  
Have the time of our lives, never take it slow  
So tonight gonna live, gonna let it go  
To the young and the reckless come and catch the disease  
Gonna stay up all night'n do whatever we please  
Because you only die once so today we seize  
So don't wait up, wait up, give it up to me  
  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't coming home 'til the sun comes up  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't sitting down 'til we can't stand up  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't gonna stop 'til we've had enough  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't coming home 'til the sun comes up  
  
Night is young, having fun  
Someone spiked the punch  
Gonna rage, gonna riot 'til we lose our lunch  
Up all night, sleep all day, gonna do it right  
So tonight going hard, going hard tonight  
Break out the hard days nights and escape the dream  
Another good man down another played out theme  
We're gonna stay out all night, there's a dawn to see  
So don't wait up, wait up, give it up to me  
  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't coming home 'til the sun comes up  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't sitting down 'til we can't stand up  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't gonna stop 'til we've had enough  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't coming home 'til the sun comes up  
  
Line 'em up, tip 'em back  
Let the fun begin  
Save your red Solo cup, fill it up again  
So what's up?  
All dressed up and nowhere to go  
Take a chance, come with me, all you never know  
It's you against the world, like a movie scene  
So throw another one back like a party fiend  
You know all we got is now, nowhere else to be  
Get up, stand up and come with me!  
  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't coming home 'til the sun comes up  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't sitting down 'til we can't stand up  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't gonna stop 'til we've had enough  
Don't wait up for us  
Cause we ain't coming home 'til the sun comes up  
  
Don't wait up, don't wait up!  
Don't wait up, don't wait up!  
  
'Til the sun comes up!  
  
Don't wait up, don't wait up!  
Don't wait up, don't wait up!



I can't give you anything but love  
Baby  
  
That's the only thing I've plenty of  
Baby  
Dream a while  
Scheme a while  
  
We're sure to find happiness  
And I guess  
All those things you've always pined for.  
Gee  
I'd like to see you looking swell  
Baby  
  
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell  
Baby.  
Till that lucky day  
You know darned well  
Baby.  
I can't give you anything but love.



It might've been a Saturday night  
It ain't clear it was so long ago  
It was somewhere across the county line  
A dance or a party I don't know  
But I do know you looked like an angel  
And your eyes were the color of your dress.  
  
There's a million things I don't remember  
But that's the one thing that I won't forget.  
  
It might've been a Saturday night  
It was either my folks car or yours  
I know that we went to some drive-in  
What was playing that night I'm not sure  
But I am sure you whispered you loved me  
As my lips softly pressed against your neck.  
  
There's a million ...  
  
After a while I guess we agreed  
We had wings we needed to test  
Somehow we talked ourselves out of love  
That such close to love as I've gotten yet.  
  
It was 2:21 on a Sunday  
And I found myself standing in the rain  
You blew me a kiss through the window  
As your greyhound was pulling away  
Inside I was dying to stop you  
I should've listened to my heart  
And not my head.

There's a house somewhere I know where's the fire's burning all night long  
There's a swing outside on the porch where I feel like I'll  
Rock away the dusk until the dawn  
And even though the wind may be howlin'  
The stars are bright and they push me on and on  
  
There's a half moon risin' in the south eastern skies  
There's a cold wind blowing across the great divide  
And the stars they guide my way across the night  
There's a half moon rising  
It's pushin' me on to another mountain top  
Push me on, no no I'll never stop, push me on home  
There's a half moon rising in the south eastern skies tonight  
  
Now the shoes on my feet, those soles broken down  
And my coat is tattered and worn  
And the hunger in my belly, and the fever in my head  
Will vanish 'ere my first glimpse of home  
And even though the rain may now be fallin'  
The passion is deep and pushes me on  
  
There's a half moon risin' in the south eastern skies  
There's a cold wind blowing across the great divide  
And the stars they guide my way across the night  
There's a half moon rising  
It's pushin' me on to another mountain top  
Push me on, no no I'll never stop, push me on home  
There's a half moon rising in the south eastern skies tonight  
  
There's a still at dawn like the sound of your loves breath  
As she lies sleeping  
Down below me now in the valley  
Is the only piece on earth that I ever want to know  
And her lips are as soft as I remember  
She alone has brought me back on home  
  
There's a half moon risin' in the south eastern skies  
There's a cold wind blowing across the great divide  
And the stars they guide my way across the night  
There's a half moon rising  
It's pushin' me on to another mountain top  
Push me on, no no I'll never stop, push me on home  
There's a half moon rising in the south eastern skies tonight



It doesn't make any sense  
This tragic ending  
In spite of the evidence  
There's something still missing  
  
Heard some of the rumors told  
A taste of one's wealth  
Did Victoria wound his soul?  
Did she bid him farewell?  
  
One last time  
We'll lay down today  
One last time  
Until we fade away  
One last time  
We'll lay down today  
One last time  
We slowly fade away  
  
Here I am inside his home  
It holds the many clues  
To my suspicions  
And as I'm standing here right now  
I'm finally shown what I have always known  
  
Coincidence I can't belive  
As my childhood dreams alowly come true  
  
Are these her memories  
Awakened through my eyes  
This house has brought back to life  
  
An open door  
I walk on through  
Into his bedroom  
  
Feeling as cold as outside  
The walls disappear  
To some woman who's screaming  
A man pleads forgiveness  
His words I cannot hear



You're so wonderful, I adore you,  
I adore you, I adore you, Victrola.  
You're so audio, don't remove me,  
To a movie, I am grooving, Victrola.  
Ahhh... Happy New Year  
Ahhh... Happy New Year

With you so near  
We both live here  
Happy New Year,  
You're my sweet dear Victrola Victrola-ahhh-ahhh.  
  



Blue Jean, I just met me a girl named Blue Jean  
Blue Jean, she got a camouflaged face and no money  
Remember they always let you down when you need 'em  
Oh, Blue Jean, is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean  
She got a police bike  
She got a turned up nose  
  
Sometimes I feel like  
(Oh, the whole human race)  
Jazzin' for Blue Jean  
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)  
Blue Jean can send me  
(Oh, somebody send me)  
Somebody send me  
(Oh, somebody send me)  
  
One day I'm gonna write a poem in a letter  
One day I'm gonna get that faculty together  
Remember that everybody has to wait in line  
Blue Jean, look out world you know I've got mine  
She got Latin roots  
She got everything.



Sharks don't attack the Irish,  
It's mostly Australians.  
There's nothing accomplished  
By these splashing citizens.  
From the Moon down to the surface  
Of the Mariana's Trench  
I won't send you in a cab when  
I can take you there myself then steal a look  
Over your shoulder at  
The distant lights of your firmament.  
  
When the sharks finished the Irish  
And those people from Berlin.  
We left our look of the landed  
With one of rescue's imminent  
From the Moon down to the surface  
Of the Mariana's Trench  
I won't send you in a cab when  
I can take you there myself then steal a look  
Over your shoulder at  
The chandeliers of your firmament.  
It's your firmament, baby.



I'd sing more about moral of this land but all God's children ain't free  
I'd open up every door I can cause all God's children ain't free  
I met a beaten broken man he shovels dirt but got no land  
And he held out his hand to me all God's children ain't free  
  
I'd sing along too a silly song but all God's children ain't free  
I'm gonna sing the blues for the men they done wrong  
'Cause all God's children ain't free  
Mister how bout the man you condemn to die  
  
But taking everything that he's livin' by  
And reject him from society all God's children ain't free  
No reject him from society all God's children ain't free  
  
[Harmonica]  
  
I'd be happy walking any street but all God's children ain't free  
I'd have a smile for all I meet but all God's children ain't free  
I'd whistle down the road but I wouldn't feel right  
I'd hear somebody cryin' out at night  
  
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all God's children ain't free  
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all God's children ain't free



No smoke without fire  
If the sky was light  
And the moon shine brightly  
Then we?d be away tonight  
Better chance be taken  
Than love forsaken  
This ain't no mistake that I'm making.  
  
Baby the angels are here,  
Brought me a Bible and a gun,  
Baby I wanted to stay with you,  
But they're saying I?d better run,  
Cause heaven?s a footstep away.  
  
Well I was hoping to make it  
Sometimes you put it together  
Before you try  
Let it take it?s course,  
Because you just can't force it  
And I don't want to break down and cry.  
  
Baby the angels are here,  
Brought me a Bible and a gun,  
Baby I wanted to stay with you,  
But they're saying I?d better run,  
Cause heaven?s a footstep away.



Goodbye desperado  
If they hadn't sucked out all the poison  
From your veins you'd be dead by now  
Too late frida kahlo  
You could have the power of the phoenix  
And the flame if you knew just how  
  
Come the hour  
Come the mantra  
Repeat in defeat with the pots and the pans  
Walk away  
Walk on water  
They're young then they're old then they don't give a damn  
  
Yeah but you  
You're out of control  
Your babies are changing  
You're out of control  
  
Sleepless situation  
Shaken by the clatter of the clinking  
On the bars of your private jail  
Twisted ultimatum  
Searching for a lifeline or a band aid  
For your sins in the morning mail  
  
Tow the line  
Floating islands  
They're here and they're now but they're oceans away  
Tie them down  
Baby lions  
You'll bleed and you'll plead and you'll beg them to stay  
  
Yeah but you  
You're out of control  
Your babies are changing  
You're out of control  
  
Don't be afraid now  
Your cover is blown  
Don't shed a tear now  
Your babies are grown



I'm the sky  
'Cause the sky doesn't sing in my song in the wind  
I can dodge  
Both your eyes with my smile  
'Cause I'm singing my song  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
Long ago  
I was blinded, my mind couldn't see  
The world's sorrow  
Every place that I went in the stillness  
I left people alone  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
Till one day  
In the spring, in the springtime I saw a good day  
And I heard as a child laughing wild  
That I heard you can grow  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
When you grow  
In the springtime you'll sing loudly songs in your soul  
In the air you can feel all the life  
And the force you've been weary  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free  
  
It's love, it's mine  
It's yours, it's life  
It's free



The things you do  
Aren't good for my health  
The moves you make  
You make for yourself  
The means you use  
Aren't meant to confuse  
Although they do  
They're the ones that I would choose  
  
And I wouldn't want it any other way  
You wouldn't let me anyway  
  
Dangerous  
The way you leave me wanting more  
Dangerous  
That's what I want you for  
Dangerous  
When I am in your arms  
Dangerous  
Know I will come to harm  
  
The lies you tell  
Aren't meant to deceive  
They're not there  
For me to believe  
I've heard  
Your vicious words  
You know by now  
It takes a lot to see me hurt  
  
And I couldn't take it any other way  
But there's a price I have to pay

I love to sit and watch you work the room  
You could have anyone you want to  
But I know you're going home with me  
Just when I think I've got you figured out  
You spin me faster than the speed of sound  
But I know you know it makes me want you more  
(Makes me want you more)  
  
Boy you're turning me on  
I wanna be the bed that you'll be laying on  
I wanna be yours  
Your anything and everything, I wanna be that song  
That's coming through your headphones  
  
Just like the purple lake in your tattoo  
That's how close I wanna be to you  
I'm in your skin, I'm playing in your head  
(Playing in your head)  
  
Am I turning you on  
I wanna be the bed that you'll be laying on  
I wanna be yours  
Your anything and everything, I wanna be that song  
That's coming through your headphones  
  
I let my world revolve around you  
I whisper sweet things in your ear  
I've never loved but I'm about to  
Can't you feel us going there  
  
Am I turning you on  
I wanna be the bed that you'll be laying on  
I wanna be yours  
Your anything and everything, I wanna be that song  
That's coming through your headphones



There is somewhere, someplace  
In this world I want to take you  
Look out little girl, little girl  
  
I am one boy, one boy in a thousand  
That wants to make you  
Look out little girl, little girl, little girl look out  
  
If you're hiding and I'm hiding  
From some bum that wants to get you  
Look out little girl, little girl  
  
If you're lonely and I'm lonely  
And I'm near you I can hear you  
Look out little girl, little girl, little girl look out  
  
Sea over yonder when the rights are read your name-ah  
You search for the riddle to the clue the river she came  
Look out on the land to the south  
To the east three said-ah  
Cancel Colorado in the march  
By request  
Don't go on the look out of a whim  
Aye she said



Now that you can't have me  
You suddenly want me  
Now that I'm with somebody else  
You tell me you love me  
I slept on your doorstep  
Begging for one chance  
Now that I finally moved on  
You say that you missed me all along  
  
[Chorus]  
Who do you think you are?  
Who do you think I am?  
You only love to see me breaking  
You only want me 'cause I'm taken  
You don't really want my heart  
No, you just like to know you can  
Still be the one who gets it breaking  
You only want me when I'm taken  
  
You're messing with my head  
Girl that's what you do best  
Saying there's nothing you won't do  
To get me to say yes  
You're impossible to resist  
But I wouldn't bet your heart on it  
It's like I'm finally awake  
And you're just a beautiful mistake  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Thank you for showing me  
Who you are underneath  
No, thank you, I don't need  
Another heartless misery  
You think I'm doing this to make you jealous  
And I know that you hate to hear this  
But this is not about you anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now that you can't have me  
You suddenly want me



City sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of christmas  
Children laughing, people passing  
Greeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you hear  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be christmas day  
Strings of street lights, even stop lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids hunch  
This is santa's big scene  
And above all the bustle you hear  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be christmas day



In Your presence I quiet my soul  
And I hear Your voice  
In my spirit I hear the sound  
Of salvation's song  
Jesus, Jesus  
  
I will wait in Your word, oh Lord  
There Your spirit speaks  
Bringing life to the weary soul  
To the depths of me  
Jesus, Jesus [x2]  
  
I love You with all my heart  
I love You with all my soul, Lord  
I love You with all my strength  
With all that is within me  
[x2]  
  
I'll sing cause You saved my soul  
I'll sing of Your love forever  
I'll worship with all my heart  
With all that is within me  
Jesus, Jesus [x6]  
  
I love You with all my heart  
I love You with all my soul, Lord  
I love You with all my strength  
With all that is within me  
  
I'll sing cause You saved my soul  
I'll sing of Your love forever  
I'll worship with all my heart  
With all that is within me  
Jesus, Jesus [x4]



Everybody always asks me  
How I got to play so fine  
And friends, I'm gonna tell ya  
It really did take some time  
  
Yes, after years and years of practice  
And a case of real bad knees  
While the other guys were out playin' with the football  
I was home bangin' on the keys  
And it got me  
  
Right were I am, this is me  
Playing the piano  
I hope ya like what I do  
It's for you, and I'll try and sing right too  
  
I guess I'm really very lucky  
That I've got this thing to play  
'Cause it can really make me feel good  
Even when it's cloudy and grey  
  
Yes, after years and years of practice  
And awful allergies that made me sneeze  
And now the other guys are out playin' with their girlfriends  
And I was still bangin' on the keys  
And it got me  
  
Right where I am, this is me  
Playing the piano  
I hope ya like what I do  
It's for you  
And I'll try and sing right too  



Took a look down a westbound road right away I made my choice  
Headed out to my big two wheeler I was tired of my own voice  
Took a bead on the northern plains and just rolled that power on  
  
Twelve hours out of Mackinaw City stopped in a bar to have a brew  
Met a girl and we had a few drinks and I told her what I'd decided to do  
She looked out the window a long long moment then she looked into my eyes  
She didn't have to say a thing I knew what she was thinkin'  
  
Roll roll me away won't you roll me away tonight  
I too am lost I feel double crossed  
And I'm sick of what's wrong and what's right  
We never even said a word we just walked out and got on that bike  
And we rolled  
And we rolled clean out of sight  
  
We rolled across the high plains  
Deep into the mountains  
Felt so good to me  
Finally feelin' free  
Somewhere along a high road  
The air began to turn cold  
She said she missed her home  
I headed on alone  
  
Stood alone on a mountain top starin' out at the Great Divide  
I could go east I could go west it was all up to me to decide  
Just then I saw a young hawk flyin' and my soul began to rise  
And pretty soon  
My heart was singin'  
  
Roll roll away I'm gonna roll me away tonight  
Gotta keep rollin' gotta keep ridin' keep searchin' till I find what's right  
And as the sunset faded I spoke to the faintest first starlight  
And I said next time  
Next time  
We'll get it right



International sensation, you know  
And Mister Worldwide, dale!  
  
I'm like a quarterback, I got options  
But I played the point in school  
Broke ankles, more than a few  
Broke hearts, yeah, that too  
20 Years later, same movie, same script,  
Same player, more chips, more women, more haters  
Different toilet, same shh  
Why get caught up in the motions?  
Why go through the same emotions?  
In a sick way she love to see me mad  
It gets her wetter than the ocean  
She's a good girl gone bad  
But bad girls don't like good guys  
Now tell me if you think I'm a good guy  
That's what I thought huh let's ride  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did,  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
Woo!  
  
They act hard but they got soft hearts  
And I know they're soft spots  
I meet them, I greet them, I train them  
And show them all about hard knocks  
Listen, next thing you know next thing you know)  
They holding the fort down like Fort Knox (Fort Knox)  
Then they fall in love and make everything seem what is not  
Damn, these are called rules of engagement  
Welcome to the world of entertainment  
They don't want a man like Reeman  
They want a man that's stuck in the remains  
I know it's ironic, but the good girls like bad guys  
Now tell me, do you think I'm a good guy?  
That's what I thought, now let's ride  
  
Woo!  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed  
  
Woo!  
  
All the things you do, all the things you say  
Playing with my heart so I can run away  
All the things you did  
All the things you said to me said to me, said  
Now I'm lonely in my bed



Verse 1  
Through her cries for mercy  
She heard their call for death  
She was pleading for her very life  
With every passing breath  
Though she knew that she was guilty  
And the price that she would pay  
But mercy knelt down from the throne  
And washed her guilt away  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Though the story's different  
My guilt was just the same  
For sin had brought it's burden  
And left it's filthy stain  
But in my cry for mercy  
Grace came down from the throne  
Telling me the price was paid  
And through His blood I've been atoned  
  
Chorus  
Now I've been washed  
In the blood  
I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb  
All my sin stains of scarlet are now white as snow  
I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb  
  
Verse 3  
Sometimes in human weakness  
My mind replays the past  
The pain and tears of yesteryears  
Bring failures rushing back  
Though many times I've failed Him  
And it seems I can't go on  
He reminds me of His precious blood  
That the stain of sin is gone  
  
Bridge  
Unworthy of His sacrifice  
My life was at an end  
But the Lamb of God laid down His life  
So that I could live again



Do you think she's swimming in your lies?  
Do you think it's all just murky green?  
Don't you think that she would realize?  
Yeah do you think she has never seen?  
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low  
When the waves retire to the darkness below  
I know I know Ruby sees all.  
I know I know Ruby sees.  
I can feel the pressure building high.  
You should see you're headed for a storm.  
Don't you see it building in the sky?  
Don't you think it's time to swim to shore?  
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low,  
When the waves retire to the darkness below,  
I know, I know Ruby sees all.  
I know, I know Ruby sees all.  
I know, I know Ruby sees.



See the white light  
The light within  
Be your own disciple  
Fan the sparks of will  
For all of us waiting  
Our kingdom has come  
  
Rays of power shining  
Rays of magic fall  
On the golden voice that speaks within us all  
For all of us waiting  
Your kingdom will come  
  
Kingdom Come  
  
Feel the white light  
The light within  
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win  
For all of us waiting  
Your kingdom will come  
  
Kingdom Come  
  
Words of power  
Calling to us all  
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall  
No longer waiting  
Our kingdom has come  
  
Kingdom Come  
  
Kingdom coming  
Another kingdom falls  
The rightful are waiting  
But all are not rightful  
Wait and receive the weight of the fall  
  
Kingdom Come



Livin' with my eyes closed, goin' day to day  
I never knew the difference, I never cared either way  
Lookin' for a reason, searchin' for a sign  
Reachin' out with both hands, I gotta feel the kick inside  
All fired up  
Now I believe there comes a time  
All fired up  
When everything just falls in line  
All fired up  
We live an' learn from our mistakes  
All fired up, fired up, fired up, hey  
  
Ain't nobody livin', in a perfect world  
Everybody's out there, cryin' to be heard  
Now I got a new fire, burnin' in my eyes  
Lightin' up the darkness, movin' like a meteorite  
  
[Chorus:]  
All fired up  
Now I believe there comes a time  
All fired up  
When everything just falls in line  
All fired up  
We live an' learn from our mistakes  
All fired up, fired up, fired up  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
Now I believe there comes a time  
When everything just falls in line  
We live an' learn from our mistakes  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
  
Now I believe there comes a time  
When everything just falls in line  
We live an' learn from our mistakes  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
Now I believe there comes a time  
When everything just falls in line  
We live an' learn from our mistakes  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
Now I believe there comes a time  
When everything just falls in line  
We live an' learn from our mistakes  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
Now I believe  
  
[Chorus]



It was fascination  
I know  
And it might have ended  
Right then, at the start  
Just a passing glance  
Just a brief romance  
And I might have gone  
On my way  
Empty hearted  
  
It was fascination  
I know  
Seeing you alone  
With the moonlight above  
Then I touch your hand  
And next moment  
I kiss you  
Fascination turned to love  
  
It was fascination  
I know  
Seeing you alone  
With the moonlight above  
Then I touch your hand  
And next moment  
I kiss you  
Fascination turned - to - love



Have yourself a Merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a Merry little Christmas  
Make the yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
  
Once again as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us will be near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hanging a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a Merry little Christmas now



Perhaps it was something that hit me, perhaps it was something I ate,  
But out of the blue I dreamed I met you and you said to me, "Hi, ya Gate!"  
Millions have heard you play Chopin, the critics applaud and approve,  
But millions more would simply adore to hear you get in the groove.  
  
You won't believe it, you'll think it's a dream  
To hear them riffing it, right on the beam,  
But when you hear trumpets give out a call, you'll know  
The Joint Is Really Jumpin' down at Carnegie Hall  
  
Instead of Strauss they play Irving Berlin,  
Instead of Brahms it's "Begin the Begin"  
Those classic ackies are due for a fall since  
The Joint Is Really Jumpin' down at Carnegie Hall  
  
They're playing  
Ta-tlee-a-ti, Ta-tlee-a-ti, with Shostakovich,  
Ta-tlee-a-ti, Ta-tlee-a-ti, Mozart and Bach,  
Ta-tlee-a-ti, Ta-tlee-a-ti, and they don't know which,  
'Cause anything can happen when they start to rock.  
  
The philharmonic was so dignified  
But now they're groovy and starting to ride,  
Handel and Haydn are facing the wall  
'cause The Joint Is Really Jumpin' down in Carnegie Hall.  
  
They-hey swing ev'rything with a ding dong  
And when the Maestro gives them a beat, it's a  
Reet Beat that starts 'em to toot with a  
Root Toot that's a bit of alright,  
And even Jose Iturbi getting hep, he's hep, he's hep.  
Boy!  
  
Tschai-Tschai-Tschai-kovsky would really be hurt  
To hear 'em jivin' his Piano Concert,  
Beethoven's lucky, he can't hear at all  
Because the Joint Is Really Jumpin' down at Carnegie Hall.



Love feels lost  
Where is it to be found?  
My heart is still here

Roses of red fall on my head  
He smiled then turned away  
Roses of red grow in my heart  
They bloom when he passes me by  
'Cause he he makes me happy  
And he he makes me fly  
Oh oh oh ...  
I bloom when he passes me by  
If you want paradise  
Then look at my eyes  
I'm as clear as the sky when it's blue  
If you want paradise  
Then look at me twice  
'Cause I'm not a normal red rose  
And he he makes me crazy  
And he he makes me fly  
Oh oh oh ...  
I bloom when he passes me by  
I know that he doesn't know me  
He's just too different no no  
I know he knows and he knows I know  
We're just too different no no  
Roses of red fall on my head  
He smiled then turned away  
Roses of red fall in my heart  
They bloom when he passes me by  
Oh oh oh ...  
I bloom when he passes me by  
Oh oh oh ...  
Smiled and turned away  



If I was a king all bitches would blow me  
Big bag piles of jewels for my homies  
We would go to war and take everybodys land  
No clothes alound for female citizens  
Titties and nedens exposed for the public  
I run around gropin these hoes and the love it  
Give these little kids a little somthin to drink  
You free all hookers and pimps out the clink  
New days mutha fucka I rewrite the laws  
Everybody gotta get a SV tag 'cause  
We run this bitch parades on daily  
Every criminal out there gotta pay me  
Fuck that five hoes lickin my ass  
We sit around bonfires burnin our cash  
Dance for me hoe and feed me grapes before I throw that ass to the snakes  
  
If I was a king  
You mother fuckers wouldn't have to worry about a damn thing  
I got this bitch  
Shits under control  
I got this bitch  
Shits under control  
If I was a king  
You mother fuckers wouldn't have to worry about a damn thing  
I got this bitch  
Shits under control  
I got this bitch  
Shits under control  
  
if I was a king there wouldn't be no generals  
I call the shots pimp cups with emeralds  
I piss in my own halls clean that shit up  
I sleep for weeks in a time wouldn't get up  
I wouldn't do shit but accumulate paper  
Lookin' at the penthouse of a skyscrapper  
Its all mine all blew out the window  
I let it blow everywhere rain on the people  
Fine hoes no autographs only bubble baths  
Nedens get blown out and thrown in the trash  
The balls in my nut bag will be to big ass diamonds  
You see them through my underwear shinin'  
Step back when the king is comin' down the street  
With the murderest fleet rumbling your feet  
I'm riding on a dinosaur if I was a king with the hair on my hoes they suck my
dick and everything  
  
If I was a king  
You mother fuckers wouldn't have to worry about a damn thing  
I got this bitch  
Shits under control  
I got this bitch  
Shits under control  
If I was a king  
You mother fuckers wouldn't have to worry about a damn thing  
I got this bitch  
Shits under control  
I got this bitch  
Shits under control  
  
if I was king id shoot arrows in my city  
If they hit somebody then there luck was shitty  
When you meet this king do more then bow  
Do three somersaults and a flip some how  
Id send ninja assassins to kill other kings  
And run around there lands settin' fire to things  
Bendtime power this king wouldn't care  
And I would sample every mother fuckin' neden out there  
  
If I was a king  
You mother fuckers wouldn't have to worry about a damn thing  
I got this bitch  
Shits under control  
I got this bitch  
Shits under control  
If I was a king  
You mother fuckers wouldn't have to worry about a damn thing  
I got this bitch  
Shits under control  
I got this bitch  
Shits under control

I've been runnin' through the night  
Tryin' to reach and hold you tight  
I've been wonderin' just why you stayed away  
But when I reached your home  
I found out that you had gone  
I found out someone had taken you away  
Ever since the day I cared all my dream we've shared  
And my love for you grown stronger every day  
And now you've said good-bye all I do is cry  
I've been wonderin' just why you went away  
  
Ever since the day I cared all my dream we've shared  
And my love for you grown stronger every day  
And now you've said good-bye all I do is cry  
I've been wonderin' just why you went away  
Won't you come on back to my side  
Please oh please don't hurt my pride  
Tryin' to get along without you ain't so good  
And if you play along I will say that I was wrong  
'Cause my love for you grows stronger like it should  
'Cause my love for you grows stronger like it should



Pernah ku lihat dia  
Gadis yang manis manja  
Makin lama ku pandang  
Makin cantik menawan  
Lalu ku tegur sapa  
Dia senyum menggoda  
Hati gemas membara  
Ku tanyakan namanya  
  
Reff:  
Ya Fatimah ya Fatimah  
Ya Fatimah ya Fatimah  
  
Hatiku rindu dendam  
Waktu ku perpisahan  
Seakan semua hilang  
Hanya dia ku kenang  
Tidur aku tak dapat  
Makan ku pun tak enak  
Ahtiku ingin dekat  
Walau hari khiamat  
  
Kembali ke Reff  
  
Pernah ku lihat dia  
Ya Fatimah  
Gadis yang manis manja  
Ya Fatimah  
Lalu ku tegur sapa  
Ya Fatimah  
Dia senyum menggoda  
Ya Fatimah  
Hatiku rindu dendam  
Ya Fatimah  
Waktu ku perpisahan  
Ya Fatimah



It don't matter to the sun  
If you go or if you stay  
I know the sun is gonna rise  
Shine down on another day  
There will still be a tomorrow  
Even if you choose to leave  
'Cause it don't matter to the sun (oh baby)  
It matters to me  
  
It ain't gonna stop the world  
If you walk out that door  
This old world will just keep on turning 'round (Turning 'round)  
Like it did the day before  
'Cause see to them it makes no difference (ohh)  
It just keeps on keepin' time  
'Cause it ain't gonna stop the world (Oh baby)  
But it'll be the end of mine  
  
What can I say  
What can I do  
I'm still in love  
So without you...  
  
(GuitarPiano solo)  
Mmm mmm mmm, oh yeah, oh yeah  
What can I say  
What can I do  
I'm still in love  
So without you  
  
It don't matter the moon  
If your not in my life  
No the moon will just keep hangin' 'round (hangin' 'round)  
Like it's just another night  
Find another place to shine on down  
On some other lovers dreams  
'Cause it don't matter the moon (oh baby)  
But is sure do matter to me  
No it don't matter to the moon (oh baby)  
But it matters to me



I got a day without nothing to do  
And a "do not disturb" on my door  
I sorta looked for some mess that she'd made  
Or her sweet little socks on the floor  
But all that she left here was too many rooms  
And just enough silence to break  
And I can't look at her picture right now  
Time's about all I can take.  
Last night I sewed up her toys that were torn  
And packed her suitcase again  
She looked so sweet as she lay there asleep  
Smiling and holding my hand  
We didn't talk all the way to the plane  
But she's too big now to cry  
Then when I kissed her, she held me so tight  
I couldn't tell her goodbye.  
Chorus:  
She said, "I wish that we lived together again  
It gets so lonesome apart  
I'm missing somebody all of the time  
Daddy, it's breaking my heart"  
It's not so bad out here living alone  
Comfort's a stranger away  
And there's a freedom you find on your own  
That's nearly worth what you pay  
It's just a shame she still wants us to be  
All that we seemed to before  
But we can't blame her for making believe  
Something we don't anymore.  
Chorus:  
She said, "I wish that we lived together again  
It gets so lonesome apart  
I'm missing somebody all of the time  
Daddy, it's breaking my heart"  



They call me love  
They call me dear  
They kiss off and leave me  
For their own career  
I got a satellite dish, I'm all alone  
With my little goldfish  
And eminem, em on my headphones  
You heard that yet? You will!  
  
Selfish pigs put the blame on me  
So hacked off what I came to be  
I'm off the tracks  
Now I'm all at sea  
They like jogging more than they like me  
  
I'm evil  
Evil no.2  
  
Then need to have something,  
Becomes the seed to have anything  
The lonely tears have dried up  
And the brain cells start to fry  
My heart cries out for new things  
Turns to anything will do things  
My left sides like a train crash  
Form all the things I tried  
  
I was so scared  
I was lonely  
I got mixed up  
Now I'm only  
  
I'm evil  
Evil no.2  
  
Mummy and daddy's on prozac  
Said they're happy but  
They won't be back  
I hope they have a heart attack  
'cause of what they done to me  
  
They left me for a wine bar  
They left me for the wrong car  
I dunno how I got this far  
  
I'm evil  
Evil no.2  
  
Eminem ain't so far away from this  
  
Mummy got a boyfriend  
Daddy got a girlfriend  
Gotta go away at weekends  
I tell you what I'll do  
Take every pill that I see  
You can do what you want to me  
I'm only trying to break free  
From the evil that you do  
  
I'm evil  
Evil no.2



If there are any words  
That we haven't said  
Let us say them  
I know all too well  
How people's lies  
Betray them  
  
More than ever  
I'll wait for you there  
More than ever  
I will need you to care  
And I'll never need  
More than a prayer  
To be near you  
To be near you  
  
Time is a baby child  
Found in the rain born of fever  
She'll bring you pretty songs  
Laced through with lies  
But don't you believe her  
  
More than ever  
I'll wait for you there  
More than ever  
I will need you to care  
And I'll never need  
More than a prayer  
To be near you  
To be near you  
To be near you  



Wrap your arms around me  
When you're so far away,  
At the end of each day  
Counting the moments  
'Till you fade away.  
Inside my soul,  
Under passion's control,  
Are feelings I can't find  
The words to explain  
Just like the first time  
I'm helpless again.  
[Chorus]  
Wrap your arms around me  
Let your love surround me  
Make love to me now like never before.  
Wrap your arms around me  
From the day you found me  
You'll never be alone.  
  
The nights are so cold,  
With just your memory to hold  
I've tried to be strong,  
Reaching out holding on.  
Alone in my bed,  
I cling to each word you said,  
Wanting you more everyday we're apart  
And each precious moment  
Is safe in my heart.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take me in your arms  
Hold me  
You are the one,  
Only you I want to be with you  
We belong together  
We were so close  
The nights are so cold  
Want to be with you  
Miss you anyway  
I want to be with you  
Hold me, love me, love me  
Just like the first time  
I'm helpless again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wrap your arms around me  
And you'll never be alone  
Wrap your arms around me  
You'll never be alone  
No, you'll never be alone.



There's a law in what we do  
We got a quest for something new  
Everything you witness seems to  
Let you down  
If someone gets you from behind  
I got an open mind  
And you've been thirsty for the friend you found  
  
Close your eyes and make a wish  
I don't wanna mess with mother nature  
Knowing that you're mine  
You said I could see  
You with another and we all get satisfied  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a form of evolution  
It's a kind of movin' on  
An eternal source of pleasure  
In being the one  
When your love is for the giving  
It's a case of destiny  
You know we look for the same insane games  
Got to be commital to be a little deviation  
  
So I get all wound up inside  
I can see your scene unwind  
You dance together or you dance alone  
And leave the real world in the air  
Love it in leather I don't care  
Everything is legal in the danger zone  
  
Close your eyes and make a wish  
Later we could cater to the animal  
Knowing that you're mine  
It's straight in my face  
You and your lover and the brain is paralyzed  
  
It's a form of evolution  
It's a kind of movin' on  
It's a cycle of emotion  
In being the one  
In the storm of revolution  
What is done can be undone  
You know we look for the same insane games  
Got to be committal  
To the subtle variations  
  
It's a form of evolution  
It's a kind of movin' on  
It's a cycle of emotion  
In being the one  
If your love is for the givin'  
It's a case of destiny  
And you can find your source of pleasure  
In being with me  
  
[Chorus]



Come on turn it up, madness  
Stalking the night, feeding fast on my prey  
Draining the life till the dawn of the day  
Drinking and sucking, the blood rushing sweet  
Half crazed with glory, half crazed in the heat  
Blood lust  
Tearing the flesh of the weak and the child  
Sparing no one, the meek and the mild  
I sink my fangs in your neck as you dream  
I am Count Cronos, vampire supreme  
Blood lust  
Blood lust upon me, I'm biting the flesh  
I'll take away your God given breath  
Now, I shall feast on your life giving blood  
Leave you to die on the land you once stood  
Blood lust  



Well, show me the way  
To the next whiskey bar  
Oh, don't ask why  
Oh, don't ask why  
  
Show me the way  
To the next whiskey bar  
Oh, don't ask why  
Oh, don't ask why  
  
For if we don't find  
The next whiskey bar  
I tell you we must die  
I tell you we must die  
I tell you, I tell you I tell you we must die  
  
Oh, moon of Alabama  
We now must say goodbye  
We've lost our good old mama  
And must have whiskey, oh, you know why  
  
Oh, moon of Alabama  
We now must say goodbye  
We've lost our good old mama  
And must have whiskey, oh, you know why  
  
Well, show me the way  
To the next little girl  
Oh, don't ask why  
Oh, don't ask why  
  
Show me the way  
To the next little girl  
Oh, don't ask why Oh, don't ask why  
  
For if we don't find  
The next little girl  
I tell you we must die  
I tell you we must die  
I tell you, I tell you I tell you we must die  
  
Oh, moon of Alabama  
We now must say goodbye  
We've lost our good old mama  
And must have whiskey, oh, you know why



Harry! Harry! Where do you go when the lights go out  
Harry! Harry! Where do you go when the lights go out

Harry! Harry! Where do you go?  
  
Thank you Mr. Miner  
Thank you Mr. Miner  
Thank you Mr. Miner

Thank you Mr. Miner  
  
Thank you Mr. Hood  
  
I can feel good (I feel good) about Hood!

In the morning I pack up my gear  
and toss it in my carryall  
Run the wide load to the lip  
and watch the big core crack and glow  
  
In the evening I undo my belt  
Split open and melt  
  
I wake up on my stomach  
with my face between my hands  
and crawl along the floor toward the doorway  
Jumping to my feet  
I try to put myself together  
but I feel it in my knees  
and the room begins to spin  
and I slip and bump my head and raise a welt  
Split open and melt  
  
We breathe deep  
in a steam dream  
and plunge below the water line  
down, down, down  
between beams  
to the gloom room  
among the seaweed and the slime  
down, down, down  
Melt



Nothing but a Child Glass upon me walking on the ocean  
Sun upon me walking on a wave  
You can slide like the lord above.. You're a beam of teaming motion  
But for everyone you do,  
There's always one or two like me you can't save  
Sail on Maria, burn her to the ground  
Slide your hand between her tears until she comes  
Wake up her mother, tell her You're sorry now  
All gods children walk before they run  
Everything is beautiful in dreamland  
Everything is much, much better when we're gone  
Think I'm going to write myself a letter  
Something you can keep with you forever  
Because everybody gets to be perfect when they're gone  
Nothing but a child baby  
Nothing but a child baby  
Nothing but a child baby...  
In You're arms, I am



From early in November to the last week of December  
I got money matters weighing me down  
Oh the music may be merry, but it's only temporary  
I know Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
In the days I work my day job, in the nights I work my night  
But it all comes down to working man's pay  
Getting ready, I'm getting ready, ready for Christmas Day  
  
(Getting ready for Christmas Day  
And let me tell you, namely, the undertaker, he's getting ready for your body  
Not only that, the jailer he's getting ready for you  
Christmas Day. Hmm? And not only the jailer, but the lawyer, the police force  
Now getting ready for Christmas Day, and I want you to bear it in mind)  
  
I got a nephew in Iraq it's his third time back  
But it's ending up the way it began  
With the luck of a beginner he'll be eating turkey dinner  
On some mountain top in Pakistan  
  
Getting ready, oh we're getting ready  
For the power and the glory  
And the story of  
Christmas Day  
  
(Getting ready, for Christmas Day  
Done made it up in your mind that I'm going, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago  
I'm going, on a trip, getting ready, for Christmas Day  
But when Christmas come, nobody knows where you'll be  
You might ask me. I may be layin' in some lonesome grave  
Getting ready, for Christmas Day)  
  
Getting ready, oh we're getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day  
Yes, we're getting ready  
  
(Getting ready, ready for your prayers,  
"I'm going and see my relatives in a distant land"  
Getting ready, getting ready for Christmas Day)  
  
If I could tell my Mom and Dad that the things we never had  
Never mattered we were always okay  
Getting ready, oh ready, ready for Christmas Day  
Ready, getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day



Johnny has a problem  
Johnny is out of control  
He had a TV party  
With the kids in the black hole  
Stealing people's mail  
And lynching the landlord  
Things to do when angry, young and bored  
  
Johnny was only a lad  
Johnny hates the scene  
First he hit an old man  
Then he hit and run Pauline  
The record player spinning the best times  
I never had  
So why do my old records make me sad?  
  
Cause they're so bad  
And no one seems to understand  
The glory of guitar  
When out of tune  
The off timing  
The singers who can't sing  
The beauty of love  
  
He's a teenage vegetable  
This is the last resort  
He's got P-C-P in his veins  
He lives inside a quart  
Johnny is a punk rocker  
Johnny is he queer?  
Johnny needed two bags  
And a car to commandeer  
Johnny wasn't liked much  
But he had a lot of friends  
Waits on stage  
Eating ludes  
A mindless brainwashed pig  
Johnny was a good man  
'Til the day that he got shot  
He had a jacked up Chevy  
That could blow you off the spot  
  
Johnny always needs  
More than he takes  
Forgets a couple chords  
Forgets a couple breaks  
Johnny says he's bound  
By only six strings to this world  
Johnny Quest hates sellout bands  
And Johnny puxors Ritalin  
And Johnny is an angry amputee



I heard you crying  
Somebody stole my soul  
How could I be dying?  
I turned twenty five days ago yeah  
Were all on the ground just crying out  
Would somebody save me please.  
I won't, sit around just thinkin' bout, the troubles that tomorrow brings yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm dying to be alive yeah  
I'm dying to be alive yeah  
Lets not go through our lives  
With out just dying to be alive  
  
The people you've touched  
They way you've touched them  
I hope they'd've touched you too.  
'cause in this life, its hard to tell  
What's false and what is true yea  
Were all on the ground just cryin' out  
Would somebody save me please  
I won't sit around just thinking about  
The troubles that tomorrow brings  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we all come tumbling down  
No matter how strong we all return to the ground  
Another day gone  
A day closer to fate  
And soon we'll find it's a little bit too late  
  
The things you see, the way you see them  
Will never be seen again  
Let's go through life livin' on luck  
Betting ten thousand to ten  
Mistakes I've made in this life  
I can't say why or when  
But the thing that's strange is you only live once  
I'll never look back again yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we all come tumbling down  
No matter how strong  
We all return to the ground  
In the days to come you'll say why did I wait  
You can't just leave your life up to fate.  
You've gotta turn it around before it's too late.



I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known  
  
A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost it's charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there  
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.



Somewhere in the city  
There's a struggle going on  
Someones making money  
Someones doing wrong  
Everybody searching for a little piece of gold  
(power play? )(fix a face? ) never grow old  
Its a shame  
Whos gonna take control?  
Its a game they play  
Whos gonna save your soul?  
And they're never gonna stop  
Till they reach the top  
All across the nation  
Fever takes control  
Money is temptation  
Money saves your soul  
One thing I can tell you  
Of this there is no doubt  
The rich man needs his comfort  
And the poor man does without  
Everybody loves somebody  
All around the world  
But everybody knows  
Its the rich man gets the girl  
-chorus-  
Look at all the little people  
(cowering? ) from the rain  
Standing at the bus stop  
Dreaming bout spain  
Here comes the rich man  
Driving his car  
When he was poor he was sure  
He was gonna go far  
-repeat chorus to fade-



Well, he went down to dinner in his Sunday best  
Excitable boy, they all said  
And he rubbed the pot roast all over his chest  
Excitable boy, they all said  
Well, he's just an excitable boy  
  
He took in the four a.m. show at the Clark  
Excitable boy, they all said  
And he bit the usherette's leg in the dark  
Excitable boy, they all said  
Well, he's just an excitable boy  
  
He took little Suzie to the Junior Prom  
Excitable boy, they all said  
And he raped her and killed her, then he took her home  
Excitable boy, they all said  
Well, he's just an excitable boy  
After ten long years they let him out of the home  
Excitable boy, they all said  
And he dug up her grave and built a cage with her bones  
Excitable boy, they all said  
Well, he's just an excitable boy



If I make a mark in time, I can't say the mark is mine.  
I'm only the underline of the Word.  
Yes, I'm like him, just like you, I can't tell you what to do.  
Like everybody else I'm searching through what I've heard.  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoa, Where do you go?  
When you don't want no one to know?  
Who told tomorrow Tuesday's dead  
  
Oh preacher won't you paint my dream, won't you show me where you've been  
Show me what I haven't seen to ease my mind.  
Cause I will learn to understand, if I have a helping hand.  
I wouldn't make another demand all my life.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What's my sex, what's my name, all in all it's all the same.  
Everybody plays a different game, that is all.  
Now, man may live, man may die searching for the question why.  
But if he tries to rule the sky he must fall.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now every second on the nose, the humdrum of the city grows.  
reaching out beyond the throes of our time.  
We must try to shake it down. Do our best to break the ground.  
Try to turn the world around one more time.  
Yeah, we must try to shake it down do our best to break the ground  
Try to turn the world around one more time  
  
[Chorus]



I satnd here lookin' up at the starts tonight, how can one man have so much in  
Life  
As I look around me, what a picture it paints, I'm much more than lucky, I  
Oughta give my thanks  
There's food on the table, a log on the fire, and in my woman's eyes there's  
Love and desire  
  
The blessings, sent from above, oh, the blessings, a life full of love  
When I look around I can see, all that's been given me, so I lift my eyes up  
To the sky  
I want to give my, my, my, my, my thanks for the blessings  
  
Sometimes I fall asleep at the end of the day and I forget to thank you, I'm  
Ashamed to say  
But as I lay m down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep  
I know you can hear me here on earth, thank you for giving me more than I  
Deserve  
  
The blessings, sent from above, oh, the blessings, a life full of love  
When I look around I can see, all that's been given me, so ilift my eyes up  
To the sky  
'cause I want to give my, my, my, my, my thanks for the blessings  
  
Blessings, when I look around, I can see, all that's been given me  
So, I lift my eyes up to the sky, 'cause I want to give my, my, my, my, my  
Thanks for the blessings  
The blessings, oh, the blessings



Beggers:  
Look down and see the beggers at your feet  
Look down and show some mercy if you can  
Look down and see the sweepings of the street  
Look down, look down, upon your fello man  
  
Gavroche:  
How do you do my name's Gavroche!  
These are my people, here's my patch!  
Not much to look at nothing posh!  
Nothing that you'd call up to scratch  
This is my school my high society  
Here in the slums of San Michelle  
We live off crumbs of humble piety  
Tough on the teeth - but what the hell!  
Think your poor? Think your free?  
Follow me! Follow me!  
  
Beggers:  
Look down and show some mercy if you can  
Look down, look down, upon your fellow man  
  
Enjolras:  
Where are the leaders of the land?  
Where are the swells who run the show?  
  
Marius:  
Only one man and that's Lamarque  
Speaks for the people here to go  
  
Beggers:  
See our children fed  
Help us in our shame  
Something for a crust of bread in Holy Jesus Name  
In the Lord's Holy Name  
In His Name  
In His Name  
In His Name  
  
Marius:  
Lamarque is ill and fading fast  
Won't last a week out so they say!  
  
Enjolras:  
With all the anger in the land  
How long before the judgment day?  
Before we cut the fat ones down to size  
Before the barricades arise  
  
Gavroche:  
Watch out for ol' Thenardier  
All of his family's on the make!  
Once ran a hash house down the way  
Bit of a swine and no mistake!  
He's got the gang the bleeding lay-about  
Even his daughter does her share  
That's Eponine she knows her way about  
Only a kid but hard to scare  
Do we care? Not a cuss!  
Long live us, Long live us!  
  
Beggers:  
Look down and show some mercy if you can  
Look down, look down, upon your fellow man.



You think that you're the second coming  
Sorry to say it doesn't do it for me  
Must be a drag when you're so stunning  
In all that you are  
And all that you hope to be  
  
You can have it all, take it all  
Break it all, forsake it all  
Want it all, choose it all  
Use it with no stake at all  
Keep it all, trash it all  
Lead it just like sheep it all  
Hate it all, love it all, and still  
You'll have nothing  
Yeah, yeah  
  
You think that you can walk on water  
Better be careful, it gets mighty deep  
I'd be afraid of what my thoughts were  
You never know who'd be willing  
To take that leap  
  
You can have it all, take it all  
Break it all, forsake it all  
Want it all, choose it all  
Use it with no stake at all  
Keep it all, trash it all  
Lead it just like sheep it all  
Hate it all, love it all, and still  
You'll have nothing  
Yeah, yeah  
  
When you look in the mirror  
Do you see any clearer  
Or are you blinded  
By your own vision  
Or have you ever thought  
That maybe you were wrong  
Or do you just reside  
In your illusion  
You can have it all, take it all  
Break it all, forsake it all  
Want it all, choose it all  
Use it with no stake at all  
Keep it all, trash it all  
Lead it just like sheep it all  
Hate it all, love it all, and still  
You'll have nothing  
Yeah, yeah  
  
You can have it all, take it all  
Break it all, forsake it all  
Want it all, choose it all  
Use it with no stake at all  
Keep it all, trash it all  
Lead it just like sheep it all  
Hate it all, love it all, and still  
You'll have nothing  
Yeah, yeah



Mmm, I want me somebody to hold my hand  
Somebody to love me and understand  
I want me a woman, I want a lover, I want a friend, oh  
  
I want me somebody to share my love  
Lovin' is something I gotta have  
I want me a woman, I want a lover, I want a friend  
  
I don't want a fancy gal, powder and paint  
And I don't want me a woman who thinks she's a saint  
I'm lookin' for someone who's not make believe  
And doesn't mind giving so that she may receive  
  
I want me somebody somewhere around  
That's looking for someone  
TEE pound for pound  
  
Oh, I want me a woman, I want a lover, I want a friend  
Yeah  
I want this little girl right now  
I Want to run away now  
Want her really how now  
Ah, baby  
Come on baby  
Need you right here by my side now  
I need you to protect me  
I need you to stand right by me  
And I want you  
And I want you to just

I never really thought I'd want to know  
I never thought I'd end this stand, but you know  
It's hard for me to just ignore  
Oh, it's just a matter of time  
Before I take your phone and I'll call everyone you know  
So hate me for letting go  
But you'll leave me if I try to stay  
  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep  
And the words that you speak  
Mean more to me than you'll know  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep inside  
Mean more to me  
They mean more to me than you'll know  
  
Are you living a lie, or are you living away?  
Does he know he is only just a place to stay?  
So let's just stop and rewind  
Before I lose my mind  
Before I don't wanna hear you say  
It's the worst of our types that go  
The worst who stay  
  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep  
And the words that you speak  
Mean more to me than you'll know  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep inside  
Mean more to me  
They mean more to me than you'll know  
  
You tear apart my mind  
And make me wonder where you are  
But I still remember everything  
That happened before dawn  
I'm begging you for honesty  
And all you're spitting out are lies  
Do you even have an alibi?  
I don't know, I don't know  
  
(Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica)  
(Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica)  
  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, won't you just let me go?  
All the secrets you keep inside  
Mean to more to me  
They mean more to me than you'll know  
Oh, give it up, give it up, Jessica  
Oh, give it up, give it up for Jessica  
All the secrets you keep  
And the words that you speak  
Mean more to me  
You mean more to me than you'll know  
More to me  
You mean more to me than you'll know



Eponine  
And now I'm all alone again nowhere to turn, no one to go to  
Without a home without a friend without a face to say hello to  
And now the night is near  
Now I can make believe he's here  
  
Sometimes I walk alone at night  
When everybody else is sleeping  
I think of him and then I'm happy  
With the company I'm keeping  
The city goes to bed  
And I can live inside my head  
  
On my own  
Pretending he's beside me  
All alone  
I walk with him 'til morning  
Without him  
I feel his arms around me  
And when I lose my way I close my eyes  
And he has found me  
  
In the rain the pavement shines like silver  
All the lights are misty in the river  
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight  
And all I see is him and me forever and forever  
  
And I know it's only in my mind  
That I'm talking to myself and not to him  
And although I know that he is blind  
Still I say, there's a way for us  
  
I love him  
But when the night is over  
He is gone  
The river's just a river  
Without him  
The world around me changes  
The trees are bare and everywhere  
The streets are full of strangers  
  
I love him  
But every day I'm learning  
All my life  
I've only been pretending  
Without me  
His world would go on turning  
A world that's full of happiness  
That I have never known  
  
I love him  
I love him  
I love him  
But only on my own



Oh tequila, I turn to you like a long lost friend  
I want to kiss my Mexican cousin once again  
We'll cover every emotion from happiness to sorrow  
And the conversations I forget you'll tell me about tomorrow  
When the phone calls start, am I in bed or in a hearse?  
The things you tell me about myself can't make me feel any worse  
Well I'm awful sorry you got pissed  
Just have to cross you off the list  
of my true friends...  
And tequila's where that starts and where it ends



Said the night wind to the little lamb,  
"Do you see what I see?  
Way up in the sky, little lamb,  
Do you see what I see?  
A star, a star, dancing in the night  
With a tail as big as a kite,  
With a tail as big as a kite"  
  
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,  
"Do you hear what I hear?  
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,  
Do you hear what I hear?  
A song, a song high above the trees  
With a voice as big as the sea,  
With a voice as big as the sea"  
  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,  
"Do you know what I know?  
In your palace warm, mighty king,  
Do you know what I know?  
A child, a child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him silver and gold,  
Let us bring him silver and gold"  
  
Said the king to the people everywhere,  
"Listen to what I say!  
Pray for peace, people everywhere,  
Listen to what I say!  
The child, the child sleeping in the night  
He will bring us goodness and light,  
He will bring us goodness and light"



Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to
fly  
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise  
  
Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these sunken eyes and learn to
see  
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to be free  
  
Black-bird fly  
Black-bird fly, into the light of a dark black night  
  
Black-bird fly  
Black-bird fly, into the light of a dark black night  
  
Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to
fly  
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise  
you were only waiting for this moment to arise  
you were only waiting for this moment to arise



Turn down the lights,  
Turn down the bed  
Turn down these voices inside my head  
Lay down with me,  
Tell me no lies  
Just hold me close, don't patronize  
Don't patronize me  
  
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't  
You can't make your heart feel something it won't  
Here in the dark, in these final hours  
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power  
But you won't, no you won't  
'Cause I can't make you love me,  
If you don't  
  
I'll close my eyes,  
Then I won't see  
The love you don't feel when you're holding me  
Morning will come and I'll do what's right  
Just give me till then to give up this fight  
And I will give up this fight  
  
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't  
You can't make your heart feel something it won't  
Here in the dark, in these final hours  
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power  
But you won't, no you won't  
'Cause I can't make you love me,  
If you don't

Now it's the same as before  
And I'm alone again  
  
With no sorrow for myself  
And I'm blaming no one else  
  
And closing my eyes  
And seeing you standing there  
  
Now it's the same as before  
You've touched me with your love  
  
And though you're in my heart  
We're still a world apart  
As now I'm back to the time  
Where I would search for a dream  
But no use to try anymore as before  
Someday I'll die, and maybe then I'll be with you  
  
So I'm closing my eyes  
To hear the people laugh  
  
For they're all aglow  
Not knowing where to go  
  
But is it asking too much  
When the question is what to do  
With the life I'll have  
It seems I know nothing now  
Except my love for you  
And the strength in my hands  
To go on feeding your smile



Ho! the band stopped playin'  
An' the couples stopped swayin'  
But we kept on . . . dancin!  
  
The lights went on  
An' the crowd was gone  
But we kept on . . . dancin!  
  
The janitor said, "Please let me sweep the floor!"  
So, I hummed a tune an' we danced right . . .  
through the door!  
  
It started rainin'  
But we both were insane  
An' we kept right . . . on dancin'  
  
We looked a sight  
By the traffic light  
But we . . . kept on dancin'  
  
The signal was red so we just tapped our feet  
When the light turned green  
Well, we danced across the street!  
  
( Couples parked in cars were romancin' )  
They were romancin'  
But we kept right in dancin!  
  
( Ba bum ba bum bum' )  
Our clothes were drippin'  
An' we couldn't help slippin'  
But we kept right in dancin!  
  
Our feet were sore  
When we reached your door  
But we kept right in dancin!  
  
When I kissed ya goodnight  
My heart started dancin' too  
That's when I knew . . .  
That I would dance my whole life through  
With only you . . .  
  
With only you . . .  
With only you . . .  
My whole life through  
With only you . . .

Yesterday I spent asleep  
Woke up in my clothes in a dirty heap  
Spent the night trying to make a deadline  
Squeezing complicated lives into a simple headline  
I have your face in an old Polaroid  
Tidying the childrens clothes and toys  
You smiling back at me I took the photo from the fridge  
Can't remember what Emily did  
Haven't been with a woman, it feels like, for years  
Thought of you the whole time, your salty tears  
This shitty world sometimes produces a rose  
The scent of it lingers but then it just goes  
  
Return the call to home  
  
The worst of us are a long drawn-out confession  
The best of us are geniuses of compression  
You say you're not gonna leave the truth alone  
I'm here 'cause I don't wanna go home  
Child drinking dirty water from a riverbank  
Soldier brings oranges he got out from a tank  
Waiting on the waiter, he's taking a while to come  
Watching the sun go down on Lebanon  
  
Return the call to home  
  
I got a head like a lit cigarette  
Unholy clouds reflect in a minaret  
So high above me, higher than everyone  
Where are you in the cedars of Lebanon?  
Choose your enemies carefully, 'cause they will define you  
Make them interesting 'cause in some ways they will mind you  
They're not there in the beginning but when your story ends  
Gonna last with you longer than your friends



Keeps them all waiting  
They're standing in line  
He never has to worry about being alone  
He's taking his own sweet time  
  
The man's mighty hot  
Believe it or not  
Every woman's after what the big boy's got  
They know it's all a lie but they're taking their shot  
  
He is such a smooth-talking man  
They never want to let him go  
He'll be gone when the morning comes  
Then they'll be the first to know  
  
It's just a big mistake  
Such a big mistake  
Well, it won't be the first  
It definitely won't be the last one you make  
Just a big mistake  
  
Sooner or later they're gonna find out  
He never cares about the hearts he's breaking tonight  
He's letting it all hang out  
The man's mighty tough  
Better leave before it starts to get too rough  
  
He such a smooth-talking man  
They never want to let him go  
He'll be gone when the morning comes  
Then they'll be the first to know  
  
It's a big mistake  
Such a big mistake  
Well, it won't be the first  
It definitely won't be the last one you make  
  
Such a big mistake  
Just a big mistake  
Such a big mistake  
Such a big mistake  
  
You might think you ought a call him Mr. Right  
Baby you might get a big surprise tonight  
You might think you ought a call him Mr. Right  
Baby you might get a big surprise tonight  
  
In the morning when you find him gone  
It's a big mistake  
You know you've been lied to  
In the morning when you know you're wrong  
Such a big mistake  
There's no one to cry to  
  
In the morning when you find him gone  
It's a big mistake  
You know you've been lied to  
In the morning when you're so alone  
Such a big mistake  
When you're so alone  
  
In the morning when you find him gone  
In the morning when you know you're wrong  
In the morning when you find him gone  
In the morning you'll be so alone, so alone



That girl, she's a party, all nighter  
Little 'Funky Cold Medina  
Little 'Strawberry Winer  
That girl, she's a love gone stringer  
Me a year old bum country singer  
That girl, she's the walk on the wild side  
She's the day glory snow ride  
Low ride, good time  
  
If you see her tell her I'm lookin' for  
That girl, that girl, that girl  
Hard to find, I'll be spending every night  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
Sun down, heaven town  
Drivin' 'round, hittin' the bars  
Shooting the stars  
Rollin' up on every party  
Wonder where you are  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Driving me crazy  
Something says, baby, yeah  
Baby, you're that girl, that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
That girl she's a sugar-sweet drive by  
Hold my dreams in her blue jeans oh my  
Yellow hammer south Georgia  
Mississippi chick  
Drink cherry wine  
Louisiana lipstick  
  
That girl likes to drink it up real loud  
Blowing smoke in a back broke rebel cloud  
Drop it down summer heat  
I gotta seat up high, silver rebel seat  
  
Waiting for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Hard to find  
Got me spending every night  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
Somewhere in heaven's town  
Driving wild, hitting the bars  
Shooting the stars  
Rollin' up on every party  
Wonder where you are  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Driving me crazy  
Something says, baby, yeah  
Baby, you're that girl  
  
Hair like a field of corn  
Body like a honey comb  
Smile like a country song  
Baby, where you've been?  
That girl, that girl, that girl  
That girl, that girl, that girl  
  
Looking for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Hard to find  
Got me spending every night  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
Somewhere in heaven's town  
Driving wild, hitting the bars  
Shooting the stars  
Rollin' up on every party  
Wonder where you are  
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl  
Driving me crazy  
Something says, baby, yeah  
Baby, you're that girl, that girl, that girl, that girl  
Yeah, maybe you're that girl, that girl, that girl, that girl  
  
I've been waiting for that girl  
  
Hair like a field of corn  
Body like a honey comb  
Smile like a country song  
Baby, climb on in



I am the son  
And the heir  
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar  
I am the son and heir  
Of nothing in particular  
  
You shut your mouth  
How can you say  
I go about things the wrong way?  
I am human and I need to be loved  
Just like everybody else does  
  
I am the son  
And the heir  
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar  
I am the son and heir  
Of nothing in particular  
  
You shut your mouth  
How can you say  
I go about things the wrong way?  
I am human and I need to be loved  
Just like everybody else does  
  
There's a club if you'd like to go  
You could meet somebody who really loves you  
So you go and you stand on your own  
And you leave on your own  
And you go home and you cry  
And you want to die  
  
When you say it's gonna happen "now"  
Well when exactly do you mean?  
See I've already waited too long  
And all my hope is gone  
  
You shut your mouth  
How can you say  
I go about things the wrong way?  
I am human and I need to be loved  
Just like everybody else does



All alone or so It feels  
Where are you going  
Finally knowing  
That nobody knows  
  
And if you ever need my hands  
To carry you through heavy times  
Or look in to your wondering eyes  
To remind you what you are  
  
Skyscraper  
You define the skyline  
Opposite the grapevine  
Where crows and rumors fly  
  
And if you ever need my hands  
To carry you through heavy times  
Or look in to your telling eyes  
To remind you what you are  
  
Skyscraper  
Half way to the show  
Giving every sunrise some connection  
Protection from a bitter sun  
  
Skyscraper  
You define the skyline  
Opposite the grapevine  
Where crows and rumors fly  
  
Skyscraper



I wandered near and far  
I wished upon a star  
And darling here you are, at last  
My guardian angel must have sent you  
To find me  
  
Now I've left the heartaches, behind me  
Although the road was long  
I thought that i was strong  
And now the saddest song is passed  
  
In this big world, full of losers  
The beggars can't be choosers  
I wished on my star and here you are at last  
  
In this big world, full of losers  
The beggars can't be choosers  
I wished on my star and here you are at last

The common denominator, the nigga numerator  
Never know who the hater, niggas cater to your ego  
I'm sorry like Atari whose the cousin to Coleco, Vision  
Caught a Rico, back on the street like Chico, DeBarge  
He large and got a 'Llac in the garage  
Few parts here and there, I declare hard, my lawd  
One at Clark, one at Spelman  
Both know each other and it's cool, you can tell when  
He step off in the party women jump for joy  
But all the wild niggas schemin' they gon' jump the boy  
For spittin' all that bourgeoise, my watch, my car  
I'm a star, I'd rather be a comet by far

Deliver this through your audio, ghetto mafioso  
Grow hydro, then bag it up slow  
Price that, longevity suggest make moves slow  
Take time, grow eight, react nine, blow!  
Hydro slide raw like fuck Ronaldo  
Fly ride though, shit lookin wild dope  
Then glide yo, flippin' the page, I go  
Watch five-oh, jump on my meat, ride slow  
Watch those, undercovers, cop those, rock those  
Glocks blows leave em baggy and collect spot grows  
Keep a watch froze, lean on the yacht and wash clothes  
Let the chop' blow, bag a half a block plot grows, what?

Ridin round our hood talkin' that dumb shit, your cabbage  
Is cracked, like plumber's ass, and summer's grass  
I been in the game for a minute, seen some suckas like y'all passin  
Thinkin' you're light skinned, aight then, lil' boy why you frightened?  
The Dungeon Family gon' be here nigga so keep writing  
I gotta hit The Source, I need my other half a mic  
Because that Southerplayalisticadillacmuzik was a classic, right!  
College Park, East Point and Decatur they got my back, so

Saved by Your mercy,  
Found in Your grace,  
Totally surrendered to Your embrace,  
And there's nothing more than You.  
  
See Your perfection,  
I'm lost in Your peace.  
Your faithfulness sings over me,  
And Your love is the light of my soul.  
  
And I lift my eyes to You,  
Creator of the world.  
  
And I stand in awe of You,  
Of Your glory,  
And I live to worship You,  
Son of God, King of heaven.  
  
And the angels round Your throne,  
Cry out holy,  
To the One who is to come,  
Hear us sing hallelujah.  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.



If you never had to count  
A million cheap,  
Then youve never been blue,  
Never been blue.  
If youve never had to cry  
Yourself to sleep,  
Then youve never been blue,  
Never been blue.  
I know I could go on laughing at trouble,  
Plain trouble,  
But when it concerns my heart  
The pain seems double.  
Oh, no one ever knows what I go through,  
While someone at home is babying you.  
If you never had to miss a good night kiss,  
Then youve never, no, youve never been blue.



No equation  
To explain the division of the senses  
No sound to reflect  
The radiance of time  
In the beginningest dream  
Halls of disorder  
Where we are swept to encircle dawn  
Strapped in a low car  
Racing through silence  
Trumpeting bliss  
You could kiss the world  
Goodbye  
Standing outside the courthouse  
In the rain  
Seemed like a lost soul  
From the chapel of dreams  
With a handful of images  
Faces of children  
Phases of the moon  
One little thing you get wrong  
Changes the dimensions  
Streets, swept memory  
Diffused and lost  
Like a prayer in the sun  
Sometimes you can't tell  
Whether you're waking up  
Or going to sleep  
Spiralling  
Unnumbered streets  
All the games cannot be yours  
All the sights, the treasures of the eye  
Does the divided soul remain the same?  
No equation to explain  
Destiny's hand  
Moved, by love  
Drawn by the whispering shadows  
Into the mathematics  
Of our desire  



Angels and devils share the same tables  
And that's not so wrong if you get it done right.  
Halos and horns lock up on the dance floor  
On a honkytonk Saturday night.  
  
It's a honkytonk Saturday night,  
It's not who is who, it's who will or who might.  
With luck she'll turn on 'fore they turn out the lights  
On a honkytonk Saturday night.  
  
I played the jukebox, I played some merle haggard,  
Me and the waitress think he's outta' sight.  
Then some folks got thirsty while we were dancin'  
On a honkytonk Saturday night.  
  
It's a honkytonk Saturday night,  
It's not who is who, it's who will or who might.  
With luck I'll turn her on 'fore they turn out the lights  
On a honkytonk Saturday night.  
  
With luck I'll take her home 'fore they turn out the lights  
On a honkytonk Saturday night.



Oh Donna  
Oh Doonna  
Oh Donna  
Oh Donna  
  
I had a girl Donna was her name  
Since she left me  
Well I've never been the same  
'Cause I love my girl  
Donna where can you be  
  
And now that you're gone  
I'm left here all alone  
All by myself to wander and roam  
How I love my girl  
Donna where can you be  
  
Oh Donna  
Now that you're gone  
I don't know what to do  
All my love and all my kisses  
Were for you, you just you  
  
I had a girl Donna was her name  
Since she's been gone  
I've never been the same  
'Cause I love my girl  
Donna where can you be  
  
Oh Donna  
Now that you're gone  
I don't know what to do  
All my love and all my kisses  
Were for you  
  
I had a girl Donna was her name  
Since she's been gone  
I've never been the same  
I love my girl  
Donna where, where can you be  
Oh Donna, Oh Donna, Oh Donna, Oh Donna



Drink the water to ease my pain  
Nights like these I only read about  
Nights like these I only dreamt about  
As we turned  
As we rolled  
I felt something strange  
I felt you  
Something light  
Something so bright  
I think it was the way of things  
I think it was the way of things  
Back come back again  
Get me a life  
Get me a life and see it in everything  
Through the dim light  
Through those dim lights  
I've fallen I'm falling falling falling falling  
In the endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life  
Endless life



I look inside at the scarlet room  
Places to hide in the dusty gloom  
A noisy clock and a silver spoon  
A china cup on the mantlepiece  
Gathering dust as it did in the east  
And just outside lies the garden of peace  
Oh, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in this garden has come true  
A mirror pond reflects the dawn  
Over the banks, 'cross the emerald lawn  
A breeze has come and I'm carried along  
So follow the path through the knowing trees  
And each time you laugh, it is love you release  
That love will come back in the garden of peace  
So, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in the garden has come true  
Oh, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in the garden has come true ...  



Standing by the roadside  
Old newspaper in my hand.  
Reading yesterday's headlines,  
Nothing new, I said it's all the same.  
Everywhere!  
I'm the fool of the year and I've been waiting  
Twenty five years of anticipating  
I've seen changes in my land  
  
People I'm here to tell you,  
I've been around since the world began.  
Well, Mr. Politician, reform me if you can,  
I'm an anti-establishment man.  
  
I'm tired of your treating  
All of my children the same.  
Everywhere!  
Spending all that money  
On a stupid war in Vietnam  
(When we need it at home)  
  
People I'm here to tell you,  
I think it's 'bout time that the world began (all over!)  
Well, Mr. Politician, reform me if you can,  
I'm an anti-establishment man.



(Verse 1)  
It's always been a mystery to me  
How two hearts can come together  
And love can last forever  
But now that I have found you, I believe  
That a miracle has come  
When God sends the perfect one  
Now gone are all my questions about why  
And I've never been so sure of anything in my life  
  
(Chorus)  
I wonder what God was thinking  
When He created you  
I wonder if He knew everything I would need  
Because He made all my dreams come true  
When God made you  
He must have been thinking about me  
  
(Verse 2)  
I promise that wherever you may go  
Wherever life may lead you  
With all my heart I'll be there too  
From this moment I want you to know  
I'll let nothing come between us  
And I will love the ones you love  
Now gone are all my question about why  
And I've never been so sure of anything in my life  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
(Bridge)  
He made the sun He made the moon  
To harmonize in perfect tune  
One can't move without the other  
They just have to be together  
And that is why I know it's true  
You're for me and I'm for you  
Cause my world just can't be right  
Without you in my life  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
(Tag)  
He mustve heard every prayer I've been praying  
Yes He knew everything I would need  
When God made you  
When dreams come true  
When God made you  
He mustve been thinking about me



Silver lady, lost in a haze,  
Rregretting what you are  
The memory of your claim to fame  
Is left to bitter stars.  
It hurts when people let you know  
You're not a movie star  
It's harder now than yesterday,  
As the lines begin to show.  
Waiting, crazy hotel lady,  
To try and get some wine,  
Waiting for the elevator  
To take you to your blind.  
Silver shoes and see-through blues  
Hit me right between the eyes.  
Cocktail bars, straight-edge cars,  
Are your dreams come true.  
Tomorrow shouldn't know it,  
But now it's showin' through and through.  
It hurts when people let you know  
That you're not a movie star.  



With a minute's silence for the dead  
And a minute's silence for the long-lost lovers  
No one's really in the mood for beer  
  
With a minute's silence for the child  
And a minute's silence for the grieving mothers  
There's not much talking going down here  
  
With a minute's silence for the girl  
With a minute's silence for the younger brother  
Things have never been so clear  
  
With a minute's silence for your friend  
With a minute's silence for your long-lost folk  
A minute's silence lasts a year  
  
A minute's silence seems a year  
  
And the park is filled with pain  
For this age has laid it's claim  
And the street's about to cry  
Cos it longs for passers-by  
It longs for passers-by



Who's got the brain of JFK?  
What's it mean to us now? (yeah)  
Pause, It sounds distrust  
But I can tell you this is no lie  
  
The whole world will be different soon  
The whole world will be relieving  
  
You you've been taught  
Whipped into shape now they got you in line  
Stand behind the stripes  
There will be order so give it a good mind  
The whole world will be different soon  
The whole world will be relieving  
  
And by name  
The name they gave me  
The name I'm letting go  
  
The whole world will be different soon  
The whole world will be relieving  
The whole world will be different soon, soon



How many times have you heard someone say  
If I had his money I'd do things my way  
Hmm, but little they know  
Hmm, it's so hard to find  
One man in ten with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, once I was wading in fortune and fame  
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game  
But suddenly it happened  
Hmm, I lost every dime  
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out  
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there ain't no doubt  
But one things for certain  
When it comes my time  
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.



I need a kick drum,  
A guitar now,  
And a bass line,  
Gonna show you how,  
  
How to rock  
How to dance  
How to get down,  
And all I need is a piano in my track now  
  
[Chorus:]  
Throw your hands  
Throw your hands  
Throw your hands  
Throw your hands up  
(Whoa, whoa)  
  
Cause you can't  
Cause you can't  
Cause you can't  
Cause you can't stop  
(Whoa, whoa)  
  
Can you hear me (hey)  
Do you feel it (hey)  
If you're with me go  
1-2-3  
'Cause we're here  
And we're now and we're all together  
So let's make this last forever  
  
Turn the amps up  
Turn the lights down  
Brush yourself off  
I'm a show you how  
  
How to rock  
How to dance  
How to get down,  
Everybody on the floor now  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Lets make this last forever(3x)  
  
Of all the stars in the sky tonight  
Compared to us  
Well they don't shine quite as bright  
  
[Chorus: X2]



It takes one to know one, baby  
I know how you feel  
You got your hunger  
And some problems that are real  
  
And you're dealing with some demons  
Who are driving you insane  
And I've seen them drag you screaming  
Down the hallways of your brain  
  
[Chorus]  
And you got loaded again  
Ain't you handsome when you're high  
Nothing matters  
Chase the feeling till you die  
  
Let it right on in there, baby  
Let it run your life  
Let it run your children off  
And let it run your wife  
  
Let it take the joy you love  
And turn it to despair  
You knew you knew better, baby  
You just didn't care  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Blame it on the moonlight, baby  
Think of number one  
Tangled up in two  
When you were shining like the sun  
  
With a pretty piece of hunger  
Who was younger than her eyes  
On the scale of cosmic thunder  
It's a wonder you're alive  
  
[Chorus]



Saturday night and you're still hangin' around  
Tired of living in your one horse town  
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground  
For a while  
  
So you go to the village in your tie dyed jeans  
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens  
It's like some pornographic magazine  
And you smile  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Your sister's gone out, she's on a date  
You just sit at home and masturbate  
Your phone is gonna ring soon, but you just can't wait  
For that call  
  
So you stand on the corner in your New English clothes  
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes  
Ah but still your fingers gonna pick your nose  
After all,...  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'  
  
So you decide to take a holiday  
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet  
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway  
What for?  
  
So you got everything, ah, but nothing's cool  
They just found your father in the swimming pool  
And you guess you won't be going back to school  
Anymore.  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'  
  
So you play your albums, and you smoke your pot  
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot  
Oh but still you're aching for the things you haven't got  
What went wrong?  
  
And if you can't understand why your world is so dead,  
Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head  
Well you're 21 and still your mother makes your bed,  
And that's too long  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'  
  
Captain Jack will get you high tonight  
And take you to your special island  
Captain Jack will get you by tonight  
Just a little push, and you'll be smilin'

You, you carry your dreams in your eyes  
And if someone hurts you, you cry  
And you, you live on a cloud in the sky  
And wish on the stars shooting by  
Don't let the little woes of life harm me  
Let the joy in the life your lead  
Let it charm you  
Let it charm you  
CHORUS:  
Nothing's gonna take you away  
Nothing's gonna break your heart  
Nothing's gonna take you away

You, you go barefootin' when there are showers  
You like to listen to coltrane for hours  
And you're gonna need smeone standing by  
And on me you can always rely

The weather and the clock

A little more than a coffee pot

[Intro]  
As I lay me down to sleep  
I hear her speak to me  
  
[Verse 1]  
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?  
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are moving  
I know you're happy, cause I can see it  
So tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it  
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel  
And look at all that he gave you  
You asked for one and you got two  
You know I never left you  
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you  
So I can say  
  
[Hook 1]  
Hello my only one, just like the morning sun  
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name  
Hello my only one, remember who you are  
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day  
Remember how I'd say  
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you would be  
And if you knew how proud I was  
You'd never she'd a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that  
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page  
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say  
  
[Hook 2]  
Hello my only one, remember who you are  
You got the world cause you got love in your hands  
And you're still my chosen one  
So can you understand?  
One day you'll understand  
  
[Bridge]  
So hear me out, hear me out  
I won't go, I won't go  
No goodbyes, no goodbyes  
Just hello, just hello  
And when you cry, I will cry  
And when you smile, I will smile  
And next time when I look in your eyes  
We'll have wings and we'll fly  
  
[Hook 3]  
Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun  
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name  
And you're still my chosen one  
Remember who you are  
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes  
  
[Outro]  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab (I just want you to do me a favor)  
Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me

Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me  
Tell Nori about me

Damn, she said that she a fan  
Yea I understand, but I want to get in her pants

If the brick ain't coming with a stick, I don't touch 'em  
Want that BMF with the Scorpio when I'm bustin'  
Like a bitch when she twerkin', y'all niggas workin'  
Clowin' ass niggas, we should put you in the circus  
In the cage with the lion, let him have you for dessert  
And testifying on your homie, took a dip, but was it worth it nigga?  
I'm in this bitch, she said my friend she want to fuck you  
I like your friend, but I really you know, I wanna fuck you  
And if I hit my rody he got to fuck too  
And put your middle fingers up and scream  
  
Haters, niggas mad at the paper  
Big crib, 10 car, 20 acres  
20 chains, 10 watches on my jewels  
Little watch with the chips, don't let 'em fool  
Nigga I can school you on how to look like money  
Hustla of the year, can write a book about money  
Don't pop them bottles, tryna impress them ho's  
With your re-up money, better tell dem ho's bitch

Tell a bitch I said

Tell my hater I said



I was staring through a telescope at night  
At a large light in the sky  
Its spinning lights reminded me of you  
A star spinning in orbit  
Lighting up the sky  
Or maybe it was not a star at all  
  
I was standing by the hudson river's edge at night  
Looking out across the Jersey shore  
At a neon light spelling out some cola's name  
And I thought your name should be dancing  
Beamed from satellites  
Larger than any billboard in Time's Square  
  
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
I'm the one who loves you in each and every way  
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
N.Y.C. lovers  
Tell it to your heart  
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
Tell it to your heart)  
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
Tell it to your heart)  
  
I'm on the roof, it's 5 a.m.  
I guess I couldn't sleep  
And I see this spinning light that I saw last week  
Maybe I should wake you up  
But by then it might be gone  
You never know what you see when if you look up in the sky  
  
I ran outside down a darkened street  
Listening to my boot heels click  
My leather jacket squeaked I needed a cigarette  
When I turned the corner  
My spinning light was in the street  
They were filming a commercial on T.V.  
  
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
We're no teenage movie that ends in tragedy  
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
N.Y.C. lovers  
Tell it to your heart [Repeat x 3]  
  
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
Tell it to your heart)  
[Repeat x 2]



You say it's easier  
Alone and undisturbed  
You said yes and danced before  
And got your feelings hurt  
You say most days your good  
It's not so bad this room  
Watching the rain today  
Even though it's clear and sunny  
And you fight it so hard  
How to tell if it's real or not  
  
[Chorus]  
Take a breath and listen (listen)  
Open up stop wishin' (wishin')  
All that you've been missin' (missin')  
Standing in front of you  
Everything you're fearin' (fearin')  
All the walls you're buildin' (buildin')  
Take a chance you're reason (reason)  
Standing in front of you  
Standing in front of you  
Standing in front of you  
Standing in front of you  
  
You start to sway again  
Feelin' good in your skin  
You start to remember when  
You didn't have to try  
And then the glitter turns to dust  
The color fades enough to make out pictures of a fire  
That burns like love  
You can close your eyes don't worry  
I'll still be here in the morning  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And they won't break us  
And they can't get through  
'Cause I'm gonna be here  
Standing in front of you  
  
[Chorus]



I'm up and I can take what you give  
And I'm here but I don't want you to live with me  
'Cause all I want is a taste for free  
  
I'm down and I will drag you along and around  
Until you burst into song and unwind  
And leave your new life behind for a while  
  
Cause I can see through the lines  
Cause I can see through the lines  
  
I'm down and I will drag you along and around  
Until you burst into song and unwind  
And leave your new life behind for a while  
  
I'm out and I will stay here alone and without  
Someone controlled by the phone and TV  
'Cause what it's doing to me is fine  
  
Cause I can see through the lines  
Cause I can see through the lines  
  
Oh oh  
Step into space  
Oh oh  
Alter my place  
Oh oh  
That someone else made  
Why I have stayed  
Into things I could be  
Or if I could see  
Into fog that surrounds  
And pins me to the ground  
  
I can see through the lines  
I can see through the lines  
I can see through the lines  
I can see through the lines



It's the sugar so sweet  
Kind I'd like to meet you at midnight  
And tell no one else about it  
  
I'm gonna make you mine  
'Cause I know we've got the time  
Now and then, baby  
Hey, I want you to know  
  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
  
Come on in the back of the '57  
Let me show you the way, the way to heaven  
You're looking so sweet, yes, you are  
I'm sure that you've got some heat  
  
I've got you on my mind  
You know you've got my time  
Now and then, baby  
Hey, I want you to know  
  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
  
I'm falling in love with you  
You make all my dreams come true  
I'm falling in love with you  
  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?  
I want to marry you  
Isn't that what you want, too?



If we have to wait forever, that's alright  
If you say, "Let's run away," we'll leave tonight  
I'd do anything you ever asked me to  
Girl, the reason my heart's beating is for you and you alone  
  
There's a price to pay for every choice you make  
We'll have our day no matter what it takes  
I'll be there for you whatever we go through  
Girl, the reason life's worth living is for you and you alone  
  
Oh, you and you alone are with me from now on  
Even if I never see your face again  
The love that you have shown is unlike anything I've known  
We both know it's just a matter of when  
  
I wish that we could just turn back the hands of time  
And find a way to have your world fit into mine  
I'll keep dreaming that someday it all comes true  
Girl, the reason my heart's breaking is for you and you alone  
  
Oh, you and you alone are with me from now on  
Even if I never see your face again  
The love that you have shown is unlike anything I've known  
We both know it's just a matter of when



I'm flyin' (flyin')  
In a frame of my mind that time cannot erase  
I'm seein' (seein')  
The future, the past as I lay the present to waste  
I'm scopin' (scopin')  
All these feelings I have and hopin' for them to come true  
And I'm holdin' something more precious than fine ore, baby  
I'm holdin' you  
  
I'm breathin' (breathin')  
The fumes of the grid that rid my lobe of oxygen  
I'm climbin' (climbin')  
The walls to where good and evil make amends  
I'm trippin', writhin' and squealin', pukin'  
Looking for someone like you  
And I'm holdin' something more precious than fine ore, baby  
I'm holdin' you  
  
I'm flyin' (flyin')  
In a frame of my mind that time cannot erase  
I'm seein' (seein')  
The future, the past as I lay the present to waste  
I'm scopin' (scopin')  
All these feelings I have and hopin' for them to come true  
And I'm holdin' something more precious than fine ore, baby  
I'm holdin' you  
And I'm holdin' something more precious than fine ore, baby  
I'm holdin' you



When I first met Doreen  
She was barely seventeen  
She was drinking whiskey sours in the bar  
The way she tossed 'em back  
I would've had a heart attack  
But as it is I let her drive my car  
We galloped through the boroughs  
Like a pair of horny thoroughbreds  
Until I said, "Stop the car, Doreen"  
Well, you can roll your eyes and nod  
But I swear that I saw God in the moonlight  
On a side street in the wreckage we call Queens  
Doreen, Doreen, last night, I had an awful dream  
You were laying in the arms of a man I'd never seen  
Come clean, Doreen, come clean, Doreen  
Well, I'm pulling into Cleveland  
In a seven-seater tour van  
There's eight of us, so I'm sleeping on the floor  
The guy that plays the banjo  
Keeps on handing me the old crow  
Which multiplies my sorrow, I can't take it anymore  
Doreen, Doreen, last night, I had an awful dream  
You were laying in the arms of a man I'd never seen  
Come clean Doreen, come clean, Doreen  
Now I'm begging and I'm pleading  
"Well pull over guys, I'm bleeding  
There's a fina off the highway with a phone"  
I'm calling you, Doreen  
But it rings and rings and rings  
Where is it that you are, if you aren't in our bed at home  
Doreen, Doreen, last night, I had an awful dream  
You were laying in the arms of a man I'd never seen  
Come clean, Doreen, come clean, Doreen  



Don't come to me with tears in your  
Eyes just because he couldn't be true  
And expecting me to sympathize  
I'm not at all sorry for you  
You know I realize all that you been through  
Because you treated me just  
The way he's treating you  
It's too late now to stop worryin'  
You I'm not at all sorry for you  
  
Do you remember the tears that  
I cried on the light you said he were true  
Like the tears that you now try  
To hide I'm not at all sorry for you  
You know I realize

I thought that I couldn't love again  
Till I saw you tonight  
Every word you say  
Smiles you throw my way  
Filled my heart with tenderness  
Once I was in love before  
But my heart was broken  
Every place I've been  
All the beauty I have seen  
Nothing means as much as you  
  
Baby I'm in love  
So in love with you  
I just can't believe  
That I could feel the way I do  
Yes I'm so in love  
So in love with you  
This feeling of love will never, never end  
I never thought that I could love again  
  
I have finally found someone  
Someone who really cares about the way I feel  
Everything that I do  
And fill my heart with happiness  
I've waited for a long time  
For a moment like this  
Now that I've found love  
It must not slip away  
We'll always be together  
  
Baby I'm in love  
So in love with you  
I just can't believe  
That I could feel the way I do  
Yes I'm so in love  
So in love with you  
This feeling of love will never, never end  
I never thought that I could love again



How can you live in such a state?  
Your mind is empty and you're full of hate  
The things you say and the things you do  
Mark you down as a helpless fool  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
It's gonna be all right through the night  
Tomorrow comes and you're full of shame  
Oh baby! You play the crying game  
Aaaah...  
Gonna be a long time baby  
Before we get it sorted out all right  
I'll drag you out to Utopia, baby

If you gonna do me right  
If you do the things I ask of you  
I'll tell the world tonight  
He he he he hee... All right  
You do me right, you do me wrong  
Tell me, where do I belong?  
You do me up, you do me down  
I accept it all without a frown  
You love like a woman in a fantasy  
Ha ha ha I admire you for my dream  
You dream of life and you dream of [???]  
High enough but I'm back again  
I love, I love, I love the funny ways  
Oh you throw me in a daze  
If you ever left me woman  
I'd destroy myself, sure as hell  
Aaaah...  
We're gonna ride a slow train baby  
And take all the whistles stops oh no - yes we are  
We'll put down the blinds while the carriage flies  
[? The engine burns hot?] while the fuzz is going on  
So I'll burn its [???] to ash  
Well there's a life to live and there's love to give  
Ready! Steady! Smash!  
Alright! Yeah! Uh mmh!

It's a scheme  
There's a fiend  
Why is my head spinning round in my dreams?  
It's a time and a place  
Why are all these lights popping up in my face?  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
  
There's a sign on the wall  
There's a witch with a big crystal ball  
There's an eye  
There's a heart that's pumpin faster as we run through the park  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
  
Everyone looks very strange today  
All of their faces seem to be washed away  
  
Everyones talking I can't hear a thing  
I'm on the moon why is the sky so green?  
  
I think I'm walking up the stairs  
While I'm sitting right down in my chair  
I feel so light but I'm not  
Everything's turning cold but it's hot.  
  
Or am I  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out  
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out

Beth I hear you calling  
But I can't come home right now  
Me and the boys are playing  
And we just can't find the sound  
  
Just a few more hours  
And I'll be right home to you  
I think I hear them calling  
Oh Beth what can I do  
Beth what can I do  
  
You say you feel so empty  
That our house just ain't our home  
I'm always somewhere else  
And you're always there alone  
  
Just a few more hours  
And I'll be right home to you  
I think I hear them calling  
Oh Beth what can I do  
Beth what can I do  
  
Beth I know you're lonely  
And I hope you'll be alright  
Cause me and the boys will be playing all night

Sitting in a car here  
After a party where we've seen  
Everyone we've known for years  
Well I've known you for years  
Oh but now it's all changed  
And all of my feelings  
Have been rearranged  
  
[Chorus]  
Come upstairs  
We'll be all alone  
Come upstairs  
No one will know  
Come upstairs  
We can take of the phone  
Come upstairs  
You can take of my clothes  
  
Say that it feels good  
Maybe too good to say that it feels like a dream  
You want to knock on some wood  
Well I'll give you some wood  
And I'll give you some fire  
I'll give you myself  
And I will show you my desire  
  
Come upstairs  
We'll have a few laughs  
Come upstairs  
We'll take a bath  
Come upstairs  
It's only one flight  
Come upstairs  
You can stay overnight  
  
I'll give you some wood  
Yeah, I'll give you some fire  
I'll give you myself  
And I will show you my desire  
  
[Chorus]



In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised  
Not to plan my funeral 'fore the body dies, yeah  
Come the morning light, it's a see through show  
What you may have heard and what you think you know, yeah  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside  
  
Sure to play a part, so you love the game  
And in truth your lies become one and same, yeah  
I could set you free, rather hear the sound  
Of your body breaking as I take you down, yeah  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside  
  
In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised  
Not to plan my funeral 'fore the body dies, yeah  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside



Another rainy day in New York City  
Softly sweet, so silently it falls  
As crosstown traffic crawls  
  
Memories in my way in New York City  
Tender, tough, too tragic to be true  
And nothing i can do  
  
City workers cheer  
The taxis disappear  
Another rainy day in New York City  
  
Another spacey stay in New York city  
High up in an overpriced hotel  
The view is really swell  
  
Windy, wet and gray in New york City  
No one here i really want to see  
Old friends and family  
  
So suddenly serene  
The air is fresh and clean  
Another rainy day in New York City



Weight of the world's on my shoulders  
Like I've never known before  
And the winter winds blowing colder  
And I just can't take anymore  
Feel I'm running down a dead end street  
Trying to change my direction  
All my troubles weighing hard on me  
It brings me down, down, down  
  
The only sounds I wanna hear,  
Is the music of the ocean  
And the rhythm of you breathing in my ear  
As we drift away  
And the only sight I wanna see  
Is the light of your emotion  
And the look of love from you to me  
As the night turns into day  
  
Noise in my head, getting louder  
and it's spinning me around  
something's tugging at my sleeve now,  
trying to tell me  
That I'm to high off the ground  
I can't explain it to myself  
I fear I'm gonna drown (fear I'm gonna drown)  
Standing out here in the pouring rain  
I'm going down, down, down  
  
The only sounds I wanna hear,  
Is the music of the ocean  
And the rhythm of you breathing in my ear  
As we drift away  
And the only sight I wanna see  
Is the light of your emotion  
And the look of love from you to me  
As the night turns into day  
  
So whisper words, so soft and low  
The words of love that heal  
And ease my soul  
  
The only sounds I wanna hear,  
Is the music of the ocean  
And the rhythm of you breathing in my ear  
As we drift away  
And the only sight I wanna see  
Is the light of your emotion  
And the look of love from you to me  
As the night turns into day  
Only us drift away  
  
So far away  
Drifting away  
So far away  
Drifting away  
Drift away, away, away, away, away, away



I want to know what you've got to say  
Don't want to wait any longer  
I feel a shook up since you walked my way  
You make me feel so much stronger  
  
Hey little baby  
I want to go your way  
  
This time  
I want to disregard this feeling of tainted love  
This time  
Don't want to be a part of playing the game of higher love  
When you're mine  
  
Now you see what you've done to me  
Don't want to wait so much longer  
I feel sideways up since you walked my way  
My feel for you keeps getting stronger  
  
Hey little baby  
I want to go your way  
  
This time  
I want to disregard this feeling of tainted love  
This time  
Don't want to be a part of playing the game of higher love  
Just make you mine



This happened once before  
When I came to your door  
No reply  
They said it wasn't you  
But I saw you peep through  
Your window  
I saw the light  
I saw the light  
I know that you saw me  
'Cause I looked up to see  
Your face  
  
I tried to telephone  
They said you were not home  
That's a lie  
'Cause I know where you've been  
And I saw you walk in  
Your door  
I nearly died  
I nearly died  
'Cause you walked hand in hand  
With another man  
In my place  
  
If I were you, I'd realize that I  
Love you more than any other guy  
And I'll forgive the lies that I  
Heard before, when you gave me no reply  
  
I tried to telephone  
They said you were not home  
That's a lie  
'Cause I know where you've been  
And I saw you walk in  
Your door  
I nearly died  
I nearly died  
'Cause you walked hand in hand  
With another man  
In my place  
No reply  
No reply



If this ain't love  
I guess I'll never know it even if I were as blinded by the light  
If this ain't love  
I guess I'll never know it even if it were a, give me back my sight  
I will crave you tonight, I will crave you, come tomorrow  
I will crave you for always, time brings me to the truth  
And the truth brings me back to you, back to you  
If this ain't love  
I guess I'll never know it even if the thunder strikes me down tonight  
If this ain't love  
I guess I'll never know it even if you kiss me in the broad daylight  
I will crave you tonight, I will crave you, come tomorrow  
I'll crave you for always, time brings me to the truth  
And the truth brings me back to you, back to you  
I will crave you, crave you, I will crave you  
(If this ain't love, ooh, oh)  
Crave you  
(If this ain't love)  
I will crave you  
(Crave you, crave you if this ain't love)  
Crave you  
(This ain't love, oh)  
I will crave you  
(This ain't love, crave you, yeah)  
Crave you  
(This ain't love, this ain't love)  



TELL ME OF SPRING  
Come to me at Spring  
Every little thing  
Just makes me want you so  
I, I'm like the worn leaf  
Blowing to and from  
Until I find my home  
You appear, I'm alive,  
Forget my fears, forget all the reasons  
To hide my love inside.  
(REFRAIN 2 VOICES)  
You, you brought back my love,  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my life  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
You, you brought back the light,  
(What you do to me)  
You took back the night  
(What you do to me)  
And gave me everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
I fall to the ground  
Send my prayer to the clouds  
There are no choices  
Hear the silence of sound  
Lay your head down  
And drink from the voices  
You appear I'm alive  
Forget my fears, forget all the reasons  
To hide my love inside.  
(REFRAIN 2 VOICES)  
You, you brought back my love,  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my life  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
You, you brought back the light,  
(What you do to me)  
You took back the night

And gave me everything

(SHORT MUSICAL INTERLUDE)  
(REFRAIN 2 VOICES)(TWICE)  
You, you brought back my love,  
(What you do to me)  
You brought back my life

You brought back my everything  
(when you say to me how much I need ...)  
You, you brought back the light,

(Written By Cohen, Performed In "Night Magic")  
  
(Michael) Their bodies Triumphant  
Their power unfurled  
I know I am nothing  
And women the world!  
  
A slave to their favours  
Their no and their yes  
I'm crushed in the crease  
Of a cotton dress  
  
And I'm dead except  
In their company  
And I'm only at rest  
When they motion to me  
  
And night after night  
I turn to myself  
And I raise them  
Out of my panic  
And they come to me  
Willing at last  
Inflamed and fast  
Mutual and graphic.  
  
And suddenly they drill my heart  
With cavities of absence  
And they cover their thighs  
With cellophane  
And they cover their breasts  
With a shadow  
And they nail my good right hand  
To a wall in the attic  
  
O take me away  
From the thorns and the fire  
And let me recline  
On the Throne of Desire  
  
From the Throne of Desire  
I make this solemn decree  
Every woman I want  
Will want, will want, will want  
Will more than want me!  
  
O o o

Oh, where oh where can my baby be?  
The Lord took her away from me  
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good  
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.  
  
We were out on a date in my daddy's car  
We hadn't driven very far  
There in the road, up straight ahead  
A car was stalled, the engine was dead  
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right  
I'll never forget the sound that night  
The screaming tires, the busting glass  
The painful scream that I heard last.  
  
Oh, where oh where can my baby be?  
The Lord took her away from me  
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good  
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.  
  
When I woke up, the rain was falling down  
There were people standing all around  
Something warm flowing through my eyes  
But somehow I found my baby that night  
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said  
"Hold me darling just a little while."  
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss  
I found the love that I knew I had missed  
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight  
I lost my love, my life that night.  
  
Oh, where oh where can my baby be?  
The Lord took her away from me  
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good  
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.  
Oh, oh



by T-Bone Burnett  
The power of love can make a blind man see  
Can bring a man to his knees  
  
The power of love can make a sultan grieve  
Can make a skeptic believe  
  
[CHORUS:  
The power of love is south of south  
And scorches out all the doubt  
  
The power of love is the name of names  
And burns away all the pain  
  
The power of love can make a gangster cry  
Can make a loser try  
  
The power of love can make a strong man weak  
Can make a bigot meek  
  
[CHORUS]  
The power of love can make a coward brave  
Can make a hero afraid  
  
The power of love can make a miser give  
Can make a dead man live  
  
[CHORUS]  
[CHORUS]



Said the world to the sun, "i must turn away,  
Cause my face is so ugly, I feel so ashamed  
Tell me where does the world go to hide?  
  
All the people down here, they fight everywhere  
They destroy and they poison  
They don't even care  
So where does the world go to hide?  
  
Nobody cares what will happen to me  
And nobody cares if I cry  
There must be a reason to carry on  
But the pain is so bad I could die  
  
Said the sun to the people, "now who is to blame?  
But like scared little children they all ran away  
But where can the world go to hide?  
  
Tell me where can the world go to hide?



Carols sing to the King  
Jesus Christ our Saviour  
Born this day, angels say  
In a lowly manger  
He came down to the earth  
Bringing us new birth  
Carols sing to the King  
Jesus Christ our Saviour  
  
Tidings bring! Hail the King!  
Shepherds did adore Him  
From afar, by the star  
Wise men sought and found Him  
Son of God, Son of Man  
All in all I see  
Carols raise His name praise  
He shall reign eternally  
Carols sing to the King  
Jesus Christ our Saviour



There are so many things in life to know  
Cause someone says it's right don't make it so  
This is someone somewhere who's taking notes  
There's someone telling lies sowing wild oats  
When you are moving fast, you can succeed  
Just how long can you last at twice the speed  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here's a warning: two wrongs don't make a right  
Heed the warning, and everything will be alright  
I'll keep good meter, and I'll take my time  
I'll try to stay in beat and live in rhyme  
I know from love I came, to love I'll go  
I'll live and learn and love and try to grow  
When you are moving fast, you can succeed  
Just how long can you last at twice the speed



I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
  
I still believe there's a reason, there's a meaning to why we're here  
There is a place where we can go to where we don't have to live in fear  
They're trying to tell me that the moon is in the ocean.  
And I'm just dreaming my life away  
  
I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
I still believe true love is the answer, don't turn away  
'cause I believe in love, that's the only way  
  
I believe in every moment, every heartbeat that we're here  
And we're a part of each other and forever it seems so clear  
I don't believe that I'm just walking in the darkness  
Or that I'm lost without a prayer  
  
I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
  
Oh now love is the answer and oh it's right here  
And I know we've got to remember it's only together for now and forever  
  
I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
I still believe true love is the answer  
Don't turn away, 'cause I believe in love  
'cause I believe in love, 'cause I believe in love and that's the only way.



Let's move, let's shake  
Let's bleed, let's fake  
Let's go for broke  
Let's make mistakes  
Let's see, let's win  
Let's pray, let's cheat  
Let's have another dance  
Let's watch our feet  
  
Let's die in the arms  
Of the girls we love  
Let's sell our souls  
To the man above  
  
Let's move, let's go  
Let's hop, let's start  
Let's paint the town  
Let's break a few hearts  
We'll run, we'll shout  
We'll thrash, we'll cry  
But we'll never grow old  
And we'll never die  
  
Lying on a bed  
With apollo in my arms  
Doing everything we should  
And being killed by her charms  
  
I've got apollo in my heart  
She's tearing me apart  
She looks like an angel  
Held here in my arms  
Though I close my eyes  
And I turn away  
I'm not letting go  
No, not at this stage  
Because knowing is only half of it  
No matter what they say  
And seeing her is believing  
From miles and miles away  
She's closed her eyes  
And she's turned away  
She's letting go  
And I know she'll say  
  
Let's die in the arms  
Of the girls we love  
Let's sell our souls  
To the man above

Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Would you rather I dim the lights  
Would you prefer, just like we were  
Or shall I undress for you (What do you want me to do)  
However may I pleasure you  
Fill with bubbles  
Warm you a bath  
Lay back relax  
Anything you ask  
Let me release the stress for you  
However may I pleasure you  
  
You're so perfect  
That I get nervous  
Tonight I'm at your service  
I'm so unselfish  
And though I am helpless, whatever brings you pleasure  
  
You're the reason I need  
And all that I have to give  
Is all I ever wanna do  
Is whatever pleasures you  
And if it takes me all night  
Or for the rest of my life  
I'll spend forever breaking through  
Do whatever just to pleasure you  
  
Hey Britney, it's Don Phillip  
  
Any fantasy can occur  
Will be observed  
Just say the word  
I'll do it if you want me to  
Whatever just to pleasure you  
  
If you wanna get off from that  
Lay on your back  
I got the max  
Certainly I'll pull you through  
Whatever just to pleasure you  
  
You're so perfect  
That I get nervous  
Tonight I'm at your service  
I'm so unselfish  
And though I am helpless, whatever brings you pleasure  
  
You're the reason I need  
And all that I have to give  
Is all I ever wanna do  
Is whatever pleasures you  
And if it takes me all night  
Or for the rest of my life  
I'll spend forever breaking through  
Do whatever just to pleasure you  
  
If I  
Pleasure  
Together  
Whatever  
Whenever  
Baby, with you  
  
And it's Like  
Heaven  
Together  
No matter  
Whatever  
As long as you ask me too (what do you want me to do)  
  
You're the reason I need  
And all that I have to give  
Is all I ever wanna do  
Is whatever pleasures you  
And if it takes me all night  
Or for the rest of my life  
I'll spend forever breaking through  
Do whatever just to pleasure you  
  
You're the reason I need  
And all that I have to give  
Is all I ever wanna do  
Is whatever pleasures you  
And if it takes me all night  
Or for the rest of my life  
I'll spend forever breaking through  
Do whatever just to pleasure you



Move along you're in my way.  
I've made my mind up not to stay  
And it don't matter what you do  
'cause me, I've had enough of you.  
And you can talk about the good times  
I can just remember bad times.  
There ain't nothing left for saying  
'cause there's no way that I'll be staying  
You tell me to remember  
When I told you that I'd never walk away  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey baby, don't walk away from love  
Tell me baby, ain't my love enough,  
Listen to the things I say  
And tell me why do you walk away from love?  
  
Leave you standing on your own  
It's time I spent some time alone  
Need a while to think this out  
Not sure what it's all about.  
And it's no use to sit there crying  
'cause I can see you're only lying.  
Now I'll put the past behind me  
Run some place where you can't find me.  
You tell me to remember  
When I told you that I'd never walk away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bags are packed, I just can't wait.  
Gotta get out before it gets too late,  
I don't need you any more  
And I don't need your love for sure.  
And you can talk about the good times  
I can just remember bad times.  
There ain't nothing left for saying  
'cause there no way that I'll be staying  
You tell me to remember when I told you that I'd never walk away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't walk away from love



Some people like to rock  
Some people like to roll  
But moving and a-grooving gonna satisfy my soul  
Let's have a party.  
Whoa, let's have a party  
Send them to the store let's buy some more

I've never kissed a coon  
But I shake a chicken in the middle of the room

Send them to the store let's buy some more

Let's have a party.  
Whoa, let's have a party  
Sending him to the store let's have some more  
Let's have a party tonight.  
  
We're gonna have a party tonight.



So here am I  
Quite by chance near the phone  
I could call and make you crawl into bed  
  
Questions always questions  
I'll just speak in slow motion  
About obsessions with boys on the floor  
  
Take that smile off your face  
Wipe that tear from your eye  
Don't say sorry for me  
Take that smile off your face  
Wipe that tear from your eye  
Don't say sorry for me  
  
Now look at me  
Like a stormtrooper in drag  
I'll bet you feel exactly like I do  
It's so disgusting  
I'm so tired of  
Rhythm and needles in arms  
I don't want your point of view  
  
Nothing to do  
Nothing to steal  
And there's nothing to say  
Nothing to do  
Nothing to steal  
And there's nothing to say  
  
Oh, don't cry  
Love it, love it  
I need to  
  
Stop it



I thought by now I'd forget  
Give me a sign  
I wanted more than the pain you left  
It's here all the time  
You're so out of reach,  
A disappearing star  
And still, when you look at me  
You tear me apart  
  
When you flow through me  
Surround me and light the dark  
Brand me and leave your mark  
My aching heart  
Is breaking again  
  
We've turned the page,  
And the summer's gone  
Turning to fall  
Memories paint the pictures like dreams  
I hear you call  
Was it only a dream  
When you made love to me  
And you filled my soul  
Made me whole  
And watched me cry  
My aching heart  
  
And floating somewhere  
You're there between pain and tears  
Between my love and fear  
Where no-one hears  
And I've got nothing  
No strength left to watch you fall  
Nothing left at all



You  
What you looking at?  
Head down  
Too late for that  
What you want  
What you get  
Know your place  
Don't ever forget  
  
And this is not my face  
And this is not my life  
And there is not a single thing here  
I can recognize  
This is all a dream  
And none of you are real  
I'll give anything  
I'll give anything  
Hey you  
What you running from?  
All your hate  
What you've become  
Bet you didn't think  
It would happen to you  
All used up  
Half way through  
  
And this is not my face  
And this is not my life  
And there is not a single thing here  
I can recognize  
This is all a dream  
And none of you are real  
I'll give anything  
I'll give anything



We're living in a constant fight  
Too much pressure everywhere  
And all around  
  
Don't let it pull you down  
Hold on tight  
Cling to your dreams  
  
Don't you depend on someone else  
Think for yourself and win the race  
  
The chance you got comes never twice  
Do your best, (and) do it right  
  
Time will come but don't you hide  
You are on your way  
  
You're led by God but you're not a pawn  
Should live your life, don't care 'bout any scorn  
  
Just let them fool around  
No need to cry  
Don't give up  
  
Try to be as smart as you can be  
I know you own so much ability



When you want  
A true lover  
Send for me...send for me!  
You'll never want  
Any other  
Send for me...send for me!  
I promise you  
I'll be true  
Send for me...send for me!  
  
Anytime just tell me  
Your problems  
And you'll find out, baby, I'll solve 'em.  
If you're late one mornin',  
Don't hurry.  
If you've got big trouble,  
Don't worry.  
Just depend  
On your friend  
Send for me...send for me!  
  
A-mornin', noon and night,  
In the early bright,  
Don't you fret, my pretty pet  
I'm gonna treat you right.  
  
Don't you dare  
Raise a hair,  
I'm gonna share  
Your every care.  
Anywhere,  
Oh, yeah  
Send for me...I'll be there!  
  
(Interlude)  
  
Anything  
That upsets you  
Send for me...send for me!  
I'll be there  
To protect you  
Wait and see...wait and see!  
Don't delay  
Right away  
Send for me...send for me.  
  
It's gonna be  
Twiddle-deee  
Yes sirree  
You and me  
Faithfully  
Send for me  
  
(Ad-lib to fade)



Swaying room as the music starts  
Strangers making the most of the dark  
Two by two their bodies become one  
  
I see you through the smokey air  
Can't you feel the weight of my stare  
You're so close but still a world away  
What I'm dying to say, is that  
  
I'm crazy for you  
Touch me once and you'll know it's true  
I never wanted anyone like this  
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss  
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you  
  
Trying hard to control my heart  
I walk over to where you are  
Eye to eye we meet, no word at all  
  
Slowly now we begin to move  
Every breath I'm deeper into you  
Soon we two are standing still in time  
If you read my mind, you'll see  
  
I'm crazy for you  
Touch me once and you'll know it's true  
I never wanted anyone like this  
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss  
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you  
  
It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you  
And you know it's true  
I'm crazy, crazy for you



Hold me my daddy,  
I never felt lower than dirt on the floor.  
I say hold me my daddy,  
I never felt like crying oceans before.  
  
If this means war, why are we in it?  
Might've fired off a couple of rounds, I didn't mean to begin it.  
If these are the bullets that every father and son must chew,  
Well then hold me my daddy, I forgot to say I love you.  
  
Hold me my daddy,  
It hurts me to see grown men fighting this way.  
I say hold me my daddy,  
The young and the old dog aren't having their day.  
  
This civil war, why are we in it?  
There's nobody on this flat earth, would ever want to win it.  
If these are the hot coals that every father and son walks through,  
Well then hold me my daddy, I forgot to say I love you.  
  
And if you agree we can make amends.  
All this squabbling I've hated.  
In another time and another place where our history bends,  
We could've been the best of friends and not merely related.  
  
Well these are the right words to say,  
They're difficult but still true,  
Well then hold me my daddy,  
I forgot to say I love you.  
  
(Hold him. Tight. Hold him like he was a baby.)



Darkness falls  
I thought I heard you call  
Or was it just a dream?  
I'm a little scared knowing you're out there  
So far away from me  
  
Its been so long  
Since you've been gone  
Every day I miss you more  
Now I wanna know  
Why did you have to go?  
What were you looking for?  
  
And I hope you find your way,  
But I can't wait to say  
  
You're home now, not alone now  
These arms are here to hold you  
Don't need to be afraid  
So come in cause I've been waiting for the moment  
To open up this door and I know that it's not much  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
  
So you lost your way but that's yesterday  
And I don't care where you've been  
Cause every step you've taking since you left  
Has brought you back again  
And I hope you see it clear  
My love has always been right here  
  
You're home now, not alone now  
These arms are here to hold you  
Don't need to be afraid  
So come in cause I've been waiting for the moment  
To open up this door and I know that it's not much  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
  
I'm glad you found your way  
And I hope you are here to stay  
Oooooooh  
  
You're home now, not alone now  
These arms are here to hold you  
Don't need to be afraid  
So come in cause I've been waiting for the moment  
To open up this door and I know that it's not much  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart  
Welcome to my heart ...



We're a death-marching band  
Peter Pan off the wagon  
Entertain but never trust anyone sober  
We're tasteless but taste good  
My (S)top Hat's top hat(ed)  
Unsafe cheerleaders with  
Porn poms and pipe bombs  
I won't do it with you  
I'll do it to you  
I hope this hook gets caught in your mouth  
I won't do it with you  
I'll do it to you  
Don't Say No  
Just Say Now  
I like a big car, cause  
I'm a big star  
I make a big rock and roll hits  
I'd like to love you  
but my heart is a sore  
I am, I am, I am so yours  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
I'd like to la la la la love you  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
I'd like to la la la la love you  
I'm the leader of the club  
And I've shrugged off my mouse ears  
We fly No-Class Dumbo jets  
And drive harcore-vettes  
We fight war with drugs  
And our sex always formal  
We wear lawsuits when  
We get high high high  
  
I won't do it with you  
I'll do it to you  
I hope this hook gets caught in your mouth  
I won't do it with you  
I'll do it to you  
Don't Say No  
Just Say Now  
I like a big car, cause  
I'm a big star  
I make a big rock and roll hits  
I'd like to love you  
but my heart is a sore  
I am, I am, I am so yours  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
I'd like to la la la la love you  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
Ka-boom, ka-boom  
I'd like to la la la la love you  
"Inhale, exhale, let's all hail"  
It's a depraved new world  
"Inhale, exhale, let's all hail"  
It's a depraved new world  
After all  
I like a big car, cause  
I'm a big star  
I make a big rock and roll hits  
I'd like to love you  
but my heart is a sore  
I am, I am, I am so yours  
I am a big car and  
I'm a strip bar  
You call it fake,  
I call it, "good as it gets."  
Nothing in this world is for real  
Except you are for me and  
I am so yours  
Ka-boom ka-boom



Now I lay me down to sleep  
I pray the Lord my soul to keep  
Angels on my left and right  
To keep me safe all through the night  
There's a place way up high  
Starry bright there, through the night there  
Close your eyes, let your wishes fly  
You'll be in Dreamland by and by  
Dimpled and drowsy, off you go  
Over the treetops, sliding down a rainbow  
Sleepyhead, curl up in your bed  
And 'til the sun says, "Rise and shine"  
Sleep warm in Dreamland, baby mine  
There's a place worlds away  
Time has wings there, green with springs there  
Smiles and songs bloom on every tree  
Only in Dreamland, just wait and see  
Deep down inside us, a child's still there  
Wishing for Dreamland, knowing that it's somewhere  
Though it may seem so far away  
If you believe that dreams come true  
You'll find a Dreamland waiting for you  
Mmm, go to sleep now, dear  



Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
  
Well I tried to give up  
Walking the streets when I was with you  
Snug as a bug in a rug  
Never been so alone thinking about you  
  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
Who will love me now  
  
Trying on my own  
But living alone is one thing I can never do  
I could end it all now  
But I'm not that crazy  
  
Who will love me now, who will love me now  
Who will love me now, who will love me now  
  
Oh I need all the love  
that you once used to give me  
Words are never enough  
Now you can't be with me  
I need all the love  
But who will take my hand and show me how  
Who will love me now  
  
Being home by myself  
Believing so much you'd walk through the door  
And tell me you think I'm a fool  
But you won't do that now  
You've done it so often  
  
Who will love me now, who will love me now  
Who will love me now, who will love me now  
  
Trying on my own  
But living alone is one thing I can never do  
I could end it all now  
But I'm now that crazy  
  
Who will love me now, who will love me now  
Who will love me now, who will love me now  
  
Oh I need all the love  
that you once used to give me  
Words are never enough  
Now you can't be with me  
I need all the love  
But who will take my hand and show me how  
Who will love me now



Bang on my window if  
You want to get your look out  
I felt the wind blow when  
She took her little book out  
  
I'm steady loving on the  
Lady of these pages  
Another chapter if you will  
So?  
  
Down on the river tonight  
Take off your glassess and fight  
  
Under the heliomoon I'm  
Going to pop the culture  
Blue cherry dress on you  
Is looking like a sculpture  
  
This recreation is amusing  
And confusing  
You never knew that it  
Could feel so good while losing  
  
(What you lose, your virginity)  
  
Down on the river tonight  
Take off your glassess and fight  
  
I'll be your domino  
Sit back and watch it flow  
Get so emotional  
I got a notion for  
And when a star gets bent  
I'll be your parliment  
I'll be your domino  
Sit back and watch it flow  
  
My intuition was a  
Poppin' and a shakin'  
The very thought of it was  
All too much to take in  
  
Curl up with lover we  
Could lie out on the blanket  
This canopy above i'll  
Take the time to thank it  
  
Down on the river tonight  
Take off your panties and fight  
  
I'll be your domino  
Sit back and watch it flow  
Get so emotional  
I got a notion for  
And when a star gets bent  
I'll be your parliment  
I'll be your domino  
Sit back and watch it flow  
  
I want to bury my face  
Deep in your aroma  
Her name is Lisa but  
They call her Desmadona  
  
Come out and see me for  
Some street comunication  
I think it's sweet of you  
To be my motivation  
  
I'll be your domino  
Sit back and watch it flow  
Get so emotional  
I got a notion for  
And when a star gets bent  
I'll be your parliment  
I'll be your domino  
Sit back and watch it flow



For you  
I would tattoo me  
With lines crossing into a hand  
And a heart that would never bleed  
With the twilight  
And the horse drawn on my arm  
Standing for an addiction  
Pray we go unharmed  
  
Here is my love and anger  
You see now  
These are my gods  
These are my scars  
Here is my love and anger  
Well these arms are burning  
But they're open wide  
  
Some things  
I hold too tightly  
Some things  
I'll never  
I'll never touch  
Oh but I'm wearing down the stones  
In the river  
And you see all my life  
I've painted with anger's brush  
  
Now, now could you  
Lift me through my love and anger  
You see now  
These are your gods  
These are my scars  
Lift me through my love and anger  
Ah and my arms are burning  
But they're open wide  
  
Oh  
You precious kid  
I have a motion  
And it's just for you  
I see a warrior  
Barefoot and dancing  
Oh with tears of pain and beauty  
And all of this is true  
  
For you  
Lift me through my love and anger  
You see now these are my gods  
These are your scars  
Lift me through my love and anger  
Oh and my arms are burning  
And they're open wide  
  
Pointing out the graveyards  
I will be the reaper  
If you will be  
The keeper of my heart  
  
I will be the reaper  
If you will be  
The keeper of my heart  
You are the keeper of this heart  
Of my heart



Had a sweet little girl,  
Run out and took the baby boy, people ain't that sad.  
Oh, had a sweet little girl,  
Left me, run out and took the baby boy, oh ain't that sad.  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't spend what you ain't got,  
Can't lose what you never had.  
Can't spend what you ain't got,  
Can't lose what you never had.  
  
Had some money in the bank,  
Got busted, people ain't that so sad.  
Oh, I had some money in the bank,  
Got busted, people, people ain't that sad.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Had a sweet little home,  
Got drunk, burned it down, people ain't that sad.  
Oh, had a sweet little home,  
Got drunk, burned it down, people ain't that sad.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, hmm, hmm, oh!



I know you see that don't touch sun all over me  
My pain is wet and you'll get hurt all over you  
I'm another man's woman to you I'm just bad news  
I'm dynamite so please don't light the fuse  
You turn me on but I can't turn me off I guess the switch is burried in my
mind  
The flame of love is burning just begging to be used  
I'm dynamite so please don't light the fuse  
You cannot do the damage that I'll do and the first thing I'll destroy it will
be you  
Too many other hearts and vows that I can't stand to lose  
I'm dynamite so please don't light the fuse  
[ dobro ]  
You cannot do the damage...  
I'm dynamite so please don't light the fuse  
  
  



I read the news today, oh boy  
About a lucky man who made the grade  
And though the news was rather sad  
Well I just had to laugh  
I saw the photograph.  
  
He blew his mind out in a car  
He didn't notice that the red lights had changed  
A crowd of people stood and stared  
They'd seen his face before  
Nobody was really sure  
If he was from the House of Lords.  
  
I saw a film today, oh boy  
The English army had just won the war  
A crowd of people turned away  
But I just had to look  
Having read the book  
I'd love to turn you on.  
  
Woke up, fell out of bed,  
Dragged a comb across my head  
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,  
And looking up I noticed I was late.  
  
Found my coat and grabbed my hat  
Made the bus in seconds flat  
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,  
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream.  
  
I read the news today oh boy  
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire  
And though the holes were rather small  
They had to count them all  
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.  
I'd love to turn you on.



Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew  
About you're plans to make me blue  
With some other guy that you knew before  
Between the two of us guys  
You know I love you more  
It took me by surprise I must say  
When I found out yesterday  
  
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine  
Oh I heard it through the grapevine  
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind  
Honey, honey yeah  
  
I know that a man ain't supposed to cry  
But these tears I can't hold inside  
Losing you would end my life you see  
'Cause you mean that much to me  
You could have told me yourself  
That you love somebody else  
  
Instead I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine  
Oh I heard it through the grapevine  
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind  
Honey, honey yeah  
  
People say believe half of what you see  
Son, and none of what you hear  
I can't help being confused  
If it's true please tell me dear  
Do you plan to let me go  
for the other guy you loved before  
  
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine  
Oh I heard it through the grapevine  
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind  
Honey, honey yeah



Reality is something that you rise above  
We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are  
Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run  
The fearful fall foul of fate as often as the reckless  
  
You don't need money to be rich anyhow  
Spending yourself is what it's all about  
  
No tears  
No lies  
No pain  
No doubt  
No darkness  
No confusion  
No loneliness, despair  
No more, no more  
It's all illusion  
  
If you have made mistakes  
There's always another chance for you  
You can start over again at any moment  
Any little time you choose  
  
Talk about failure  
To fall is not to fail  
Failure isn't about falling down  
Failure is staying down  
  
Energy makes energy anyhow  
Spend yourself and get rich right now  
  
No tears  
No lies  
No pain  
No doubt  
No darkness  
No confusion  
No loneliness, despair  
No way, no how  
It's all illusion  
  
Reality is something that you rise above  
We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are  
There's always another chance for you  
You can start over again  
Start over again  
Over again  
Any little time you choose  
Get rich right now



I must make up my mind today  
What to have, what to hold  
A poor man's roses  
Or a rich man's gold  
  
One's as wealthy as a king in a palace  
Tho' he's callous and cold  
He may learn to give his heart for love  
Instead of buyin' it with gold  
  
Then the poor man's roses  
And the thrill when we kiss  
Will be memories of paradise  
That I'll never miss  
  
And yet the hand that brings the rose tonight  
Is the hand I will hold  
For the rose of love means more to me  
More than any rich man's gold



Once upon a time there was a girl  
In her early years she had to learn  
How to grow up living in a war that she called home  
Never know just where to turn for shelter from the storm  
Hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face  
Every time my father's fist would put her in her place  
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room  
Hoping it would be over soon  
  
[Chorus]  
Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same  
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid  
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave  
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday  
  
And I'm OK  
  
I often wonder why I carry all this guilt  
When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built  
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door  
The echo of a broken child screaming "please no more"  
Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done  
To you it's just a memory, but for me it still lives on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's not so easy to forget  
All the marks you left along her neck  
When I was thrown against cold stairs  
And every day I'm afraid to come home  
In fear of what I might see there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'm OK  
I'm OK



In the spring of 1856, with the snow still on the ground  
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town  
The father went out hunting, the boys had stayed behind  
While mother tended to her chores, they wandered from her side  
  
The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead  
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread  
Two hundred men had gathered there to comb the mountainside  
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh mommy and daddy, why can't you hear our cries?  
The day is almost over, soon it will be night  
We're so cold and hungry, and our feet are tired and sore  
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door  
  
Now Jacob Diverd woke one night from a strange and eerie dream  
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream  
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log  
For two more nights the dream returned this vision sent from God  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A thousand men had searched in vain the west side of pop's creek  
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east  
With a guide to take him there Jacob came upon the scene  
And found the boys cold and still beneath the old birch tree  
  
Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry  
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side  
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord  
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door  
  
Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry  
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side  
And as you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord  
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door



Thinkers think about love till it comes out their ears  
Drinkers drink about love and they cry in their beers  
Now you can think about it, drink about it  
But if you're on the brink about it  
Don't fall till you know all about love  
  
Singers croon about love sing with sadness and pain  
A tycoon about love spends a fortune in vain  
Sing a dirge about it, splurge about it  
But if you're on the verge about it  
Don't fall till you know all about love  
  
You must examine your motives clearly  
Look at the facts sincerely  
Or you mess up very dearly if you don't  
  
Writers write about love till their fingers are sore  
Fighters fight about love till their flat on the floor  
You can write about it, fight about it  
Think about it, drink about it  
But there's one item I forgot to recall  
  
You can't know all about love unless you fall  
  
Ah, thinkers think about love till it comes out their ears  
And drinkers drink about love and they cry in their beers  
But you can think about it, drink about it  
But if you're on the brink about it  
Don't fall till you know all about love  
  
Writers write about love till their fingers are sore  
Fighters fight about love till their flat on the floor  
Now you can write about it, fight about it  
Think about it, drink about it  
But there's one item I forgot to recall  
  
You can't know all about love no, no  
'Cause I know all about love, yeah yeah  
You can't know all about love unless you fall  
In love  
  
You must examine your motives clearly  
Look at the facts sincerely  
Or you mess up very dearly if you don't  
  
Doctors know about love that it's bad on the nerves  
Drivers show about love that it's hard on the curves  
Lose your nerve about it, squirm about it  
Doubt about it, pout about it  
But there's one item I forgot to recall  
  
You can't know all about love no, no  
'Cause I know all about love, yeah yeah  
You can't know all about love no, no  
'Cause I know all about love, yeah yeah  
  
You can't know all about love unless you fall  
In love



No bad dream fucker's going to boss me around  
Christian Brothers going to take him down  
But it can't help me get over  
  
Don't be cross, it's sick what I want  
I've seen the boss blink on and off  
  
Fake concerns is what's the matter, man  
And you think I ought to shake your motherfucking hand  
Well, I know how much you care  
  
Don't be cross, it's sick what I want  
I've seen the boss blink on and off  
  
Come here by me, I want you here  
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear  
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear



She lives life with hungry ears  
Well that's like Julie borned in the air  
Riding away on the horses that run through my life  
You think I'm fun just watching the game  
But Julie you're messing with a naked flame  
I'm a dangerous rain that wash all your lies away  
  
Well I never, Julie you're the shape of sin  
But I can strut boy, when the line dance begins  
So cool it Julie or I'm gonna do you in  
  
Julie, Julie why do you taunt me  
Julie, Julie you're lying  
Julie, Julie Why do you haunt me  
Julie, oh Julie you lying bitch  
  
Well you think I'm just flying  
With strings of a kite  
But Julie I hope you're not for oblige  
I'm flying higher  
And I am the one holding the knife  
He's all that I got and he's all that I want  
Well Julie for the last time enough is enough  
Take it from me you'll meet no meaner woman, no  
  
Julie, Julie why do you taunt me  
Julie, Julie you're lying  
Julie, Julie Why do you haunt me  
Julie, oh Julie you lying bitch  
  
Julie, Julie why do you taunt me  
Julie, Julie you're lying  
Julie, Julie Why do you haunt me  
Julie, oh Julie you lying bitch



The heavens were silent  
The earth weeped in pain  
Nations were trembling and hope never came  
A Terror filled the air  
And it wouldn't go away  
We needed a hero to come and save  
  
Famine and hunger,  
Disease in the land  
The hatred the killing taking lives from your hand  
Creation waits through the darkness we pray  
Tell me where is the hero to come and save  
  
Through the nails  
Through the thorns  
From the hill to the grave  
Was a voice in the distance the lamb that was slain  
My soul had no song and my debt I couldn't pay  
When I needed a hero you came and you saved  
  
To the homeless  
The widow  
The fatherless son  
To the sick and the broken alone with no one  
Lift up you head your hope is on the way  
When we needed a hero you came and you saved the day  
  
When the curtain had closed  
And it felt like the end  
When your blood caught the fall and took away every sin  
Even though men deny  
You're the only sacrifice  
That loved us enough you loved us so much Lord  
That you gave your life see you saved my life  
  
Now I can see you I'm no longer ashamed  
Your power I feel see our lives have exchanged  
Every wrong is erased, Jesus  
You are my hero you came and you saved the day  
  
When the curtain had closed  
And it felt like the end  
When your blood caught the fall and took away every sin  
Even though men deny  
You're the only sacrifice  
That loved us enough you love us so much Lord  
That you gave your life see you saved my life  
  
Now I can see you I'm no longer ashamed  
Your power I feel see our lives have exchanged  
Every wrong is erased, Jesus  
You are my hero you came and you saved  
You are my hero you came and you saved  
You are my hero you came and saved the day  
  
You saved you saved the day  
You saved you saved the day  
  
You are my hero you came and you saved the day



Long drive, long night  
The best night of my life  
With you ridin'  
Your hand on my hand  
  
The thought of arriving  
Kinda feels like dying  
I don't want to go home  
And be alone  
  
Could we stay out  
Could you drive a little slower  
Don't matter where we're going  
As long as I'm with you  
We can take the long way  
  
Chevy Nova  
Front seat sofa  
Getting closer  
To you  
  
Drive a little slower  
Don't matter where we're going  
As long as I'm with you  
We can take the long way  
  
Drive a little slower  
Not ready to go home  
I rather stay with you  
We can take the long way out  
  
To the country, out of town  
Let's get lost, I don't want to be found  
Let's get away now  
  
And be careful not to crash  
It's known there's frost and we're steaming the glass  
You hit the road, have a generous shoulder  
We could pull over  
And say we took the long way  
  
Headlights  
Strobe lights  
I can see you  
But not quite  
I can feel you  
Inside  
The timing  
Is just right  
For the moment  
I don't want  
To go home  
  
Take the long way out  
Oh, oh, oh  
Take the long way now  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Drive a little slower  
Don't matter where we're going now  
Drive a little slower  
Don't matter where we're going now  
Drive a little slower  
Not ready to go home  
I'd rather stay with you  
We can take the long way  
  
Long drive, long night  
The best night of my life



So faithful, so constant and so true  
So powerful in all You do  
You fill me, You see me  
You know my every move  
You love for me to sing to You  
  
I know that You are for me, I know that You are for me  
I know that You will never forsake me in my weakness  
And I know that You have come now even if to write upon my heart  
To remind me who You are  
  
So patient, so gracious, so merciful and true  
So wonderful in all You do  
You fill me, You see me  
You know my every move  
You love for me to sing to You  
  
Lord, I know that You are for me, I know that You are for me  
I know that You will never forsake me in my weakness  
And I know that You have come now even if to write upon my heart  
To remind me  
  
Lord, I know that You are for me, I know that You are for me  
I know that You will never forsake me in my weakness  
And I know that You have come now even if to write upon my heart  
To remind me who You are  
To remind me  
  
I know that You are for me, I know that You are for me  
I know that You will never forsake me in my weakness  
And I know that You have come now even if to write upon my heart  
To remind me who You are



(Joni Mitchell)  
  
It's coming on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
They're putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
  
But it don't snow here  
It stays pretty green  
I'm going to make a lot of money  
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene  
  
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
Oh I wish I had a river so long  
I would teach my feet to fly  
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
I made my baby cry.  
  
He tried hard to help me  
He put me at ease  
Lord, he loved me so naughty  
Made me weak in the knees  
I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
I'm so hard to handle  
I'm selfish and I'm sad  
Now I've gone and lost the best baby  
That I ever had  
  
I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
Oh I wish I had a river so long  
I would teach my feet to fly  
Oh I wish I had a river  
I made my baby say goodbye  
  
It's coming on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
They're putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
I wish I had a river I could skate away on.



Walk hand in hand with me through all eternity  
Have faith, believe in me, give me your hand  
Love is a symphony of perfect harmony  
When lovers such as we walk hand in hand  
Be not afraid, for I am with you all the while  
So lift your head up high and look toward the sky  
Walk hand in hand with me, this is our destiny  
No greater love could be, walk hand in hand  
Walk with me  
Be not afraid, for I am with you all the while  
So lift your head up high and look up to the sky  
Walk hand in hand with me, this is our destiny  
No greater love could be, walk hand in hand  
Walk with me  



Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from your shoulder  
Because the years of fretting days are right behind you now  
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told  
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds  
I will show you a game where the winner never wins  
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore  
Let me sleep beside you  
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key  
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals  
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger  
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free  
I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together  
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore  
Let me sleep beside you  
Your darkened eyes throw mystery  
But your lips are void of history  
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you  
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'll like to hear  
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore  
Let me sleep beside you  
Let me sleep beside you  



Lullay, Thou little tiny Child,  
By, by, lully, lullay.  
Lullay, Thou little tiny Child,  
By, by, lully, lullay.  
  
O sisters too, how may we do,  
For to preserve this day.  
This poor youngling for whom we sing  
By, by, lully, lullay.  
  
Herod the king, in his raging,  
Charged he hath this day.  
His men of might, in his own sight,  
All young children to slay.  
  
That woe is me, poor Child for Thee!  
And ever morn and day,  
For thy parting neither say nor sing,  
By, by, lully, lullay.



It's a madman's situation,  
Reminiscing in the rain,  
And I've lost your love again,  
I call your name.  
  
And I don't want to think about it  
When I go to sleep at night,  
Can you hear it in the wind?  
I call your name.  
  
I call your name...  
And I close the door behind me,  
I turn the lights all down,  
There's no-one there beside me,  
  
I call your name.  
And I don't want to think about it  
But I wind up all the same,  
Nothing'll ever change,  
  
I call your name.  
I call your name...  
Lie awake under the stars,  
Lie awake under the stars.  
  
I call your name...



They say I'm not what I used to be  
All the same  
I'm happier than a willow tree  
Shine or rain sitting here by a stream  
(Mmm) There's nothing I'd rather feel  
In this world  
You and your sweet serenity  
Rocking me  
Melting my heart away  
  
I know something so dear to me  
Beyond words  
Beautiful feeling in my soul  
Sounds I've heard  
Like humming birds in a dream  
(Mmm) That mystical one I knew  
Is returned  
Lulling me with those raincloud eyes  
Taking me  
Melting my heart away  
  
I am yes I am  
I know what I feel  
You came in my life  
Made me more real  
  
I know whatever we may have been  
In past times  
Has sorted the truth out from the rest  
Win or lose  
I always knew you'd be there  
(Mmm) You answer my deepest prayer  
In a song  
Shimmering slowhand flowing clear  
Moving me  
Melting my heart away  
  
I am yes I am  
I know what I feel  
You came in my life  
Made me more real  
  
(Mmm) That mystical one I knew  
Is returned  
Lulling me with those raincloud eyes  
Taking me  
Melting my heart away



May it be an evening star  
Shines down upon you  
May it be when darkness falls  
Your heart will be true  
You walk a lonely road  
Oh! How far you are from home  
  
Mornie utulie (Darkness has come)  
Believe and you will find your way  
Mornie alantie (Darkness has fallen)  
A promise lives within you now  
  
May it be the shadow's call  
Will fly away  
May it be your journey on  
To light the day  
When the night is overcome  
You may rise to find the sun  
  
Mornie utulie (Darkness has come)  
Believe and you will find your way  
Mornie alantie (Darkness has fallen)  
A promise lives within you now  
  
A promise lives within you now  



I was on my way  
To getting close to you  
Until you flipped the script on me  
Another personality  
I was just that close  
To putting karats in your ring  
Until I peeped your card  
Now you threw it before you started baby  
  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up, babe  
  
You were almost in  
About to take you home with me  
Until you opened up my eyes  
And showed me your other side  
You were inches from the room  
Just about to take control  
Now that I know it was all an act  
I got's to get that bracelet back  
  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up, babe  
  
What made you think you could lie to me?  
Baby and get away with it  
Come back down to reality  
When it comes to love you just don't get it  
  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up, babe  
  
Having never lived like a lap full of g's  
When all the time you was just tryna trap me  
Closer, and closer, and closer to me  
Trying to get rooted like the ground and trees  
Now I want to get tight like the harmonies  
All you want to do is just scheme, scheme, scheme  
Riding in my gators sittin' on my things  
Drinking and smoking up all my weed  
  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up, babe



I've got a spade and a pick-axe  
And a hundred miles square of land to churn about  
My old horse is weary but sincerely  
I believe that he can pull a plough  
Well I've moved into the jungle of the agriculture rumble,  
To grow my own food  
And I'll dig and plough and scrape the weeds  
Till I succeed in seeing cabbage growing through  
  
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging  
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging  
It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming  
How calming and balming the effect of the air  
  
Well, I farmed for a year and grew a crop of corn  
That stretched as far as the eye can see  
That's a whole lot of cornflakes,  
Near enough to feed New York till 1973  
Cultivation is my station and the nation  
Buys my corn from me immediately  
And holding sixty thousand bucks, I watch as dumper trucks  
Tip New York's corn flakes in the sea  
  
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging  
Now I'm a farmer, and I'm digging, digging, digging, digging, digging  
It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming  
How calming and balming the effect of the air  
  
Now look here son  
The right thing to say  
Isn't necessarily what you want to say  
The right thing to do  
Isn't necessarily what you want to do  
The right things to grow  
Ain't necessarily what you want to grow  
Your own happiness  
Doesn't necessarily teach you what you want to know  
  
Well I'm suntanned and deep, so's the horse  
And my hands are deeply grained  
Old horse is a-grazing, it's amazing  
Just how lazily he took the strain  
Well my pick and spade are rusty,  
Because I'm paid on trust to leave my square of cornfield bare  
  
It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming  
How calming and balming the effect of the air  
  
When you grow what I grow  
Tomatoes, potatoes, stew, eggplants...  
Potatoes, tomatoes...gourds



Oh! You better watch out,  
You better not cry,  
You better not pout,  
I'm telling you why,  
Santa Claus is coming to town!  
  
He's making a list,  
Checking it twice,  
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice.  
Santa Claus is coming to town!  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping,  
He knows when you're awake.  
He knows if you've been bad or good,  
So be good for goodness sake!  
  
Oh! You better watch out,  
You better not cry,  
You better not pout,  
I'm telling you why,  
Santa Claus is coming to town!



Take me now baby here as I am  
Pull me close try an understand  
I work all day out in the hot sun  
Stay with me now till the mornin' comes  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel when I'm in your hands  
Take me now as the sun descends  
They can't hurt you now  
They can't hurt you now  
They can't hurt you now  
  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to us  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to us  
  
What I got I have earned  
What I'm not I have learned  
Desire and hunger is the fire I breathe  
Just stay in my bed till the morning comes  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel when I'm in your hands  
Take me now as the sun descends  
They can't hurt you now  
They can't hurt you now  
They can't hurt you now  
  
Because the night  
  
Your love is here and now  
The vicious circle turns and burns without  
Though I cannot live forgive me now  
The time has come to take this moment and  
They can't hurt you now  
  
Because the night



So I walk alone down the darkest roads  
'Cause I've always known how the story goes  
When the curtain falls, I'll be wearing thin  
Clawing at the walls as they're closing in  
In this twisted plot I was destined for  
I'm an astronaut on the ocean floor  
So misunderstood 'till the bloody end  
How I wish I could do it all again  
  
It feels like I'm a lone survivor  
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world  
And on my own I walk alone  
To see the sun again I'd give anything  
But life demands a final chapter  
A story that we all must leave behind  
It's do or die, and this is mine  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
  
It's another night of the living dead  
Like a viper bite in a spiderweb  
It's so deathly dark in the alleyway  
And a bleeding heart makes you easy prey  
I would run and hide for the afternoon  
With the butterfly in the panic room  
Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time  
For a different twist in the story line  
  
It feels like I'm a lone survivor  
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world  
And on my own I walk alone  
To see the sun again I'd give anything  
But life demands a final chapter  
A story that we all must leave behind  
It's do or die, and this is mine  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
  
It feels like I'm a lone survivor  
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world  
And on my own I walk alone  
To see the sun again I'd give anything  
But life demands a final chapter  
A story that we all must leave behind  
It's do or die, and this is mine  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing  
  
Tell the world I know that my mind is made  
It's a horror show, but I'm not afraid  
Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time  
For a different twist in the story line



When did you leave Heaven, Heaven?  
  
When did you leave Heaven?  
How could they let you go?  
How's everything in Heaven?  
I'd like to know  
  
Why did you trade Heaven  
For all these earthly things?  
Where did you hide your halo  
And where did you lose your wings?  
  
Have they missed you?  
Can you get back in?  
If I kissed you, would it be a sin?  
  
You know he's only human  
Yes, baby you're so divine, yes  
When did you leave Heaven?  
  
Angels  
Angels

Clock strikes upon the hour  
And the sun begins to fade  
Still enough time to figure out  
How to chase my blues away  
I've done alright up to now  
It's the light of day that shows me how  
And when the night falls, loneliness calls  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody  
I wanna feel the heat with somebody  
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody  
With somebody who loves me  
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody  
I wanna feel the heat with somebody  
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody  
With somebody who loves me  
  
I've been in love and lost my senses  
Spinning through the town  
Sooner or later, the fever ends  
And I wind up feeling down  
I need a man who'll take a chance  
On a love that burns hot enough to last  
So when the night falls  
My lonely heart calls  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody  
I wanna feel the heat with somebody  
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody  
With somebody who loves me  
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody  
I wanna feel the heat with somebody  
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody  
With somebody who loves me  
  
Somebody oo Somebody oo  
Somebody who loves me yeah  
Somebody oo Somebody oo  
To hold me in his arms oh

On a love that burns hot enough to last  
So when the night falls  
My lonely heart calls

Well a man come on the 6 o'clock news  
Said somebody's been shot, somebody's been abused  
Somebody blew up a building, somebody stole a car  
Somebody got away, somebody didn't get too far yeah  
They didn't get too far  
  
Grandpappy told my pappy, back in my day, son  
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done  
Take all the rope in Texas find a tall oak tree,  
Round up all them bad boys hang them high in the street  
For all the people to see  
  
That justice is the one thing you should always find  
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line  
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune  
And we'll all meet back at the local saloon  
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces singing  
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses  
  
We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds  
Too much corruption, and crime in the streets  
It's time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground  
Send 'em all to their maker and he'll settle 'em down  
You can bet he'll set 'em down  
  
'Cause justice is the one thing you should always find  
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line  
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune  
We'll all meet back at the local saloon  
And we'll raise up our glasses against evil forces singing  
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses  
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses  
  
You know justice is the one thing you should always find  
You got to saddle up your boys, you got to draw a hard line  
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune  
And we'll all meet back at the local saloon  
And we'll raise up our glasses against evil forces singing  
Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses  
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses



Found myself in a strange town  
Though I've only been here for three weeks now  
I've got blisters on my feet  
Trying find a friend in Oxford Street  
I bought an A to Z guide book  
Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs  
But when you ask in a strange town  
They say don't know, don't care  
And I've got to go, mate  
  
They worry themselves about feeling low  
They worry themselves about the dreadful snow  
They all ignore me 'cause they don't know  
I'm really a spaceman from those UFOs  
  
You've got to move in a straight line  
You've got to walk and talk in four four time  
You can't be weird in a strange town  
You'll be betrayed by your accent and manners  
  
You've got to wear the right clothes  
Be careful not to pick or scratch your nose  
You can't be nice in a strange town  
Cause we don't know, don't care  
And we got to go, man  
  
Rush my money to the record shops  
I stop off in a back street  
Buy myself a snort  
We got our own manifesto  
Be kind to queers  
And I'm so glad the revolution's here  
It's nice and warm now!  
  
I've finished with clubs where the music's loud  
Cause I don't see a face in a single crowd  
There's no one there  
I look in the mirror  
But I can't be seen  
Just a thin, clean layer of mister sheen  
Looking back at me  
Oh, oh  
  
Found myself in a strange town  
Though I've only been here for three weeks now  
I've got blisters on my feet  
Trying find a friend in Oxford Street  
  
I bought an A to Z guide book  
Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs  
They say don't know, don't care  
And I've got to go, mate  
  
They worry themselves about feeling low  
They worry themselves about the dreadful snow  
They all ignore me 'cause they don't know  
I'm really a spaceman from those UFOs  
  
Strange town  
  
Break it up  
Burn it down, shake it up  
Break it up



Intro  
Let us not feel an ounce of remorse  
When the time comes and the brains  
Behind the muscle get what they fucking deserve!  
  
News broadcasts ratings grow.  
War and scandal do you want to know.  
How many people died today.  
Dealt with pain and suffering  
  
Are you terrified  
For our lives  
It looks to be  
The end's in sight  
  
Go and fight for evil and lies  
Everything you stand for I despise  
I'd rather live than die for something  
Something that will never end  
  
Force them to fight so we can be free  
Until the end  
Money and power is the reality  
Until the end  
It's two things the world leaders thrive for  
  
Until the end  
And that's why this will never stop  
Until the end  
That's why this will never stop  
Until the end  
  
The end is near



Long time ago in Bethlehem  
So the Holy Nible say  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ  
Was born on Christmas day  
  
Hark now hear the angels sing  
A new king born today  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day  
  
Trumpets sound and angels sing  
Listen what they say  
That man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day  
  
While shepherds watch their flock by night  
They see a bright new shining star  
Then hear a choir sing  
The music seemed to come from afar  
  
Now Joseph and his wife Mary  
Come to Bethlehem that night  
Then find no place to born the child  
Not a single room was in sight  
  
Hark now hear the angels sing  
A new king born today  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day  
  
Trumpets sound and angels sing  
Listen what they say  
That man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day  
  
By and by they find a little nook  
In a stable all forlorn  
And in a manger cold and dark  
Mary's little boy was born



Its been a hard night for sarah  
The divorce went through today  
Ten years out the window  
She's been faithful all the way  
  
She's feeling really bitter  
She's feeling lost and small  
She wonders where it all went wrong  
  
Its been a hard night for sarah  
She's taken quite a fall  
  
Well he was all she ever hoped for  
And she gave him all she had  
Never gave a cause to worry  
Never hurt her or made her sad  
  
And no one thought to tell her  
They all figured that she knew  
Just another harmless fling  
A phase all men go through  
  
Its been a hard night for sarah  
She's going to have to see it through  
Gonna have to see it through  
  
The sun is slowly rising  
On another brand new day  
The children will be waking soon  
And shell send them on their way  
  
It's been a hard night for sarah  
It's been a hard night for sarah  
It's been a hard night for sarah  
But today is another day  
Today is another day

Pillow Talk  
Doris Day  
Written by Buddy Pepper and Inez James  
This song did not chart  
Title song from the 1959 film starring Day and Rock Hudson  
  
Pillow talk, pillow talk  
Another night of hearin' myself talk, talk, talk, talk  
Wonder how it would be to have someone to pillow talk with me  
I wonder how  
I wonder who  
Pillow talk, pillow talk  
Another night of bein' alone with pillow talk  
When it's all said and done, two heads together can be better than one  
That's what they say  
They always say  
All I do is talk to my pillow  
Talk to my pillow, talk to my pillow  
All I do is talk to my pillow  
Talk about the boy I'm gonna marry someday  
Somehow, some way, sometime  
Pillow talk, pillow talk  
Another night of gettin' my fill of pillow talk  
You and I both agree there must be a boy, must be a pillow  
Must be a pillow-talkin' boy for me  
I hope I'm right  
I'd better be right  
Oh, there must be a pillow-talkin' boy for me  
(We hope she's right, she'd better be right, there must be a boy)  
There must be a boy  
There must be a boy  
There must be a boy  
There MUST be a boy!!  
There MUST!!

We are a new creation, the old has gone, the new has come.  
Reconcile us to Himself, through Christ Jesus.  
We will be free, forever knowing what will become... of us.  
Thank you for the cross.  
Trusting in the balance has tilted me towards righteousness.  
Lifting my spirit once again, sinking not in my functioning.  
Inhale, exhale this over and over again.  
Looking for tomorrow forgetting about today.  
Dying, dying.  
Through prayer and sacrifice into all the earth,  
With love and understanding.  
Now I look to importance, standing here steadfast,  
To renew (the? or Your?) spirit within me.  
Do not cast me from Your presence,  
Or take Your Holy Spirit from me



We can drag you out of bed in the middle of the night  
Drive tanks along your street looking for a flight  
We can put you in a cell an dash away the key  
Make you stand against the wall torture chamber style  
The reason is simple, it's obvious to see  
We can shoot at you but you can't kill we  
Don't you see, don't you see, your not an army  
  
The reason is simple, it's obvious to see  
Right is on your side but the media's with we  
Don't you see, don't you see, your not an army  
  
The thing you must remember since these troubles first began  
Were supported by a tax paying population  
And if the rest of this world is against we  
It's a fact that the people of this country won't see  
  
They can give you a trial by military  
But you won't be sentenced politically  
You'll be beat by other prisoners for political views  
But you just another killer when we read it in the news



Here's the thing  
We started out friends  
It was cool, but it was all pretend  
Yeah, yeah  
Since you been gone  
  
You're dedicated, you took the time  
Wasn't long till I called you mine  
Yeah, yeah  
Since you been gone  
  
And all you'd ever hear me say  
Is how I picture me with you  
That's all you'd ever hear me say  
  
But since you been gone  
I can breathe for the first time  
I'm so moving on  
Yeah, yeah  
Thanks to you  
Now I get what I want  
Since you been gone  
  
How can I put it? You put me on  
I even fell for that stupid love song  
Yeah, yeah  
Since you been gone  
  
How come I've never heard you say  
I just want to be with you?  
Guess you never felt that way  
  
But since you been gone  
I can breathe for the first time  
I'm so moving on  
Yeah, yeah  
Thanks to you  
Now I get what I want  
Since you been gone  
  
You had your chance, you blew it  
Out of sight, out of mind  
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it  
Again, and again, and again, and again  
  
Since you been gone (since you been gone)  
I can breathe for the first time  
I'm so moving on  
Yeah, yeah  
Thanks to you (thanks to you)  
Now I get, I get what I want  
  
I can breathe for the first time  
I'm so moving on  
Yeah, yeah  
Thanks to you (thanks to you), now I get (I get)  
You should know (you should know)  
That I get  
I get what I want  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone



I left the only folks I had known  
I was fifteen then , hardly grown  
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud  
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far  
Said to myself stay right where you are  
Done found yourself a Ma and Pa  
Ev'rybody said the kid's no good  
  
Come Home Johnny Bride come home  
Johnny Bride come home  
We're all wrong without you  
How did we ever doubt you  
He confessed to the killing  
It's his role we had you filling  
We didn't really mean to make you sad  
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad  
  
(repeat last verse and fade out about line 6)



Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  
And never brought to mind?  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  
And auld lang syne?  
  
For auld lang syne, my dear,  
For auld lang syne,  
We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,  
For auld lang syne.  
  
And surely ye'll be your pint-stowp,  
And surely I'll be mine!  
And we'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,  
For auld lang syne.  
  
For auld lang syne, my dear,  
For auld lang syne,  
We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,  
For auld lang syne.  
  
We twa hae run about the braes,  
And pu'd the gowans fine



Well Jimmy played harmonica in the pub where I was born  
He played it from the night time to the peaceful early morn  
He soothed the souls of psychos and the men who had the horn  
And they all looked very happy in the morning  
  
Now Jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours  
Where the elephant man broke strong men's necks  
When he'd had too many powers  
So sad to see the grieving of the people that he's leaving  
And he took the road for god knows in the morning  
  
We walked him to the station in the rain  
We kissed him as we put him on the train  
And we sang him a song of times long gone  
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again  
(far away) sad to say I must be on my way  
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)  
I'd like to think of me returning when I can  
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally Maclennane  
  
The years passed by the times had changed I grew to be a man  
I learned to love the virtues of sweet Sally Maclennane  
I took the jeers and drank the beers and crawled back home at dawn  
And ended up a barman in the morning  
  
I played the pump and took the hump and watered whiskey down  
I talked of whores and horses to the men who drank the brown  
I heard them say that Jimmy's making money far away  
And some people left for heaven without warning  
  
We walked them to the station in the rain  
We kissed them as we put him on the train  
And we sang them a song of times long gone  
Though we knew that we'd be seeing them again  
(far away) sad to say I must be on my way  
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)  
I'd like to think of me returning when I can  
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally Maclennane  
  
When Jimmy came back home he was surprised that they were gone  
He asked me all the details of the train that they went on  
Some people they are scared to croak but Jimmy drank until he choked  
And he took the road for heaven in the morning  
  
We walked him to the station in the rain  
We kissed him as we put him on the train  
And we sang him a song of times long gone  
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again  
(far away) sad to say I must be on my way  
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)  
I'd like to think of me returning when I can  
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally Maclennane



Spiderman, spiderman  
Does whatever a spider can  
Spins a web, any size  
Catches thieves just like flies  
  
Look out here comes the spiderman  
  
Is he strong, listen bud  
He's got radioactive blood  
Can he swing, from a thread  
No escape from his spider-web  
  
Look out there goes the spiderman  
  
When chill meets the night  
at the scream of a crime  
Like a stream of light  
He arrives just in time  
Look out, life is a great big bang-up  
Wherever there is a hang-up  
You'll find the spiderman.



I love you even when I don't even know I'm doing it  
And dismiss it out of hand cause I don't even know I'm doing it but your  
Finger starts to wiggle and landscapes emerge  
Can you spare some change dear, we've only got three hundred feet to go  
  
Roses are worth more dried than alive such a thing to say  
O how I adore you when you reinvent a rose cliche can you spare  
Some change dear we've only got three hundred feet to go  
And with impossibilium for a payload we lift the rocket out of the  
Pocket nothing can stop it  
  
Roses are difficult everywhere you must promise me you'll stay  
These long stems are freakish if anything but we can cut 'em  
Down for the vase can you spare some change dear  
We've only got three hundred feet to go and with impossibilium for a Payload  
We lift the rocket out of the pocket nothing can stop it we can only watch it

If heartaches brought fame  
In loves crazy game  
I'd be a legend in my time  
  
If they gave gold statuettes  
For tears and regrets  
I'd be a legend in my time  
  
But they don't give awards  
And there's no praise or fame  
For a heart that's been broken  
Over love that's in vain  
  
If loneliness meant world acclaim  
Everyone would know my name  
I'd be a legend in my time  
  
If loneliness meant world acclaim  
Everyone would know my name  
I'd be a legend in my time



(Pork roll egg and cheese on a kaiser bun)  
  
I met her at the Living Earth Show  
She crossed the room, the lights sank low  
We're together, she really digs me she fucks me  
Who would think I could be so happy?  
When I'm cold, I know she's keepin' me warm  
We're together, she really digs me she fucks me  
  
She's in my arms, she's in my heart, yeah  
Pins and needles up and down my spine  
We're together, she really digs me now  
She fucks me, she fucks me

We came together in 1982  
Through stormy weather, we sang the blues  
You and me baby in a circle of fire  
I've had my troubles, you had yours  
We've had those feeling, but we've endured  
You and me baby in a circle of fire  
River of passion  
River of love  
You and me babe  
It's a lovers moon and the stars are out  
We're living stories that love writes about  
And I'm caught in the heat of passion's womb  
And I'm drawn in close like the tides to the moon  
It's a lovers moon and the stars are out  
We're living stories that love writes about  
And I'm caught in the heat of passion's womb  
And I'm drawn in close like the tides to the moon  
The river is wide  
The river is deep  
The river is swift  
But it's oh so sweet  
You and me baby in a circle of fire  
Just you and me baby in a circle of fire  
Just you and me baby in a circle of fire  
And I'm burnin'  
Feel me burnin' in a circle of fire  
  



Here I stand with head in hand  
I turn my face to the wall  
If she's gone I can't go on  
Feeling two foot small  
Everywhere people stare  
Each and every day  
I can hear them laugh at me  
And I hear them say  
  
Hey you've got to hide your love away !  
Hey you've got to hide your love away !  
  
How can I even try ?  
'cause I can never win  
Seeing them hearing them  
In the state I'm in  
How could she say to me "Love will find a way" ?  
Gather 'round all you clowns  
Let me hear you say  
  
Hey you've got to hide your love away !  
Hey you've got to hide your love away !



  
  
You can bump and grind.

Let it all hang out,  
  
but you won't fool the children of the revolution.  
  
No you won't fool the children of the revolution.  
  
  
You can tell a plane, in the falling rain.

No you won't fool the children of the revolution.

Consider your position position your defense  
Why don't you let me ask you is it mere coincidence  
Feeding speculators on a downhill gravy train  
Like vultures ripping out the eyes to reach the dying brain  
Listen to the wind - a silent scream  
Tearing at your broken heart  
Like a forgotten dream  
  
And there's a time for peace a time for war  
Wondering what we've been put here for  
A time for giving a time to take  
A time for love and a time for hate  
A time for beg and a time to steal  
So you gamble on that spinning wheel  
Of all these things I've had my fill  
Lord I need some time to kill  
  
Ten percent of nothing is exactly what you got  
You thing you've got the given right to take another shot  
I'll take away your money all you've got is colored beads  
Find a piece of land where you can sow your seeds  
Listen to the wind - a silent scream  
Tearing at your broken heart  
Like a forgotten dream  
  
There's a time for passion a time for pain  
A time to learn that we're all the same  
A time to remember a time to forget  
Wondering how we're going to pay our debts  
A time for thunder a time for rain  
Waiting for the seasons to change  
Of all these things I've had my fill  
Lord I need some time to kill



Relatively speaking you make me who I am  
I need you exactly like the ocean needs the land  
I need you like the sunshine needs the shadows and the night  
I need you the way love needs the savage hurtful fight  
  
Relatively speaking I'm nothing without you  
You are where I've been before you are where I'm going to  
You are living out my dreams and you are all my fears  
You evoke my laughter, you unleash every tear  
  
The rich ones need the poor ones  
The blind need those with sight  
Sinners need the pure of heart  
The black ones need the white  
  
Relatively speaking the contrast make sit go  
Every action taken is related in the flow  
Stars and losers, kings and fools go dancing hand in hand  
Relatively speaking you make me who I am  
  
Relatively speaking the contrast make sit go  
Every action taken is related in the flow  
Stars and losers, kings and fools go dancing hand in hand  
Relatively speaking you make me who I am  
Who I am



Alas, my love, you did me wrong,  
To cast me out discourteously,  
For I have loved you so long,  
Delighting in your very company.  
Now if you intend to show me disdain,  
Don't you know it all the more enraptures me,  
For even so I still remain your lover in captivity.  
Green sleeves, you're all alone,  
The leaves have fallen, the men have gone.  
Green sleeves, there's no one home,  
Not even the Lady Green Sleeves  
  
I sang my songs, I told my lies,  
To lie between your matchless thighs.  
And ain't it fine, ain't it wild  
To finally end our exercise  
Then I saw you naked in the early dawn,  
Oh, I hoped you would be someone new.  
I reached for you but you were gone,  
So lady I'm going too.  
  
Green sleeves, you're all alone  
  
Green sleeves, you're all alone,  
The leaves have fallen, the men have all gone home.  
Green sleeves, it's so easily done,  
Leaving the Lady Green Sleeves.



It's okay, it's okay (x4)  
You don't have to run and hide away  
It's okay, it's okay  
I love you anyway  
It's okay, it's okay  
You don't need to run and hide away  
It's okay, it's okay  
This is my life, this is my chance  
This is my hope in an alleyway  
This is my choice, this is my voice  
There may be no tomorrow, now  
This is my plea, this is my need  
This is my day to be free  
This is my time, this is my way  
In a world that's never safe  
It's okay, it's okay  
You gotta let me run away  
It's okay, it's okay  
Oh now let me run away  
It's okay, it's okay  
You're gonna run and hide away  
It's okay, it's okay



Who's got the stuff that made the Wild West wild?  
Who pleases ev'ry woman, man and child?  
Who does his best to give the customers a thrill?  
-Who?  
Colonel Buff'lo Bill  
  
Who's got the show that gets the most applause?  
Five hundred Indians and fifty squaws  
Ten feature acts and there's the special feature still  
-Who?  
Colonel Buff'lo Bill  
  
Did you ever see a cowboy rope a steer?  
-No, we haven't  
Or an Indian with feathers throw a spear?  
-No, we haven't  
Or a marksman shoot an earring from an ear?  
-No, we haven't  
Did you ever see a hold up?  
-No, sir  
Then gather closer  
And let me give you some of the atmosphere  
  
The hour is midnight and all is still  
We see the stagecoach climbing up a hill  
Going along a mountain trail carrying passengers and mail  
Never suspecting danger as they roll along  
The watchful driver is in his seat  
His trusty rifle lying at his feet  
Some of the passengers inside seem to be dozing as they ride  
Never suspecting there is something really wrong  
  
Suddenly there's a shout  
-What is it all about?  
What is it all about you ask? It's Indians  
-Indians!  
Indians  
-Indians!  
Very notable, cut your throat-able Indians  
-Indians!  
  
Just when they've taken ev'ryone by force  
Who makes an entrance on a big white horse?  
Who starts a' shootin' till there's no one left to kill  
-Gen'ral Grant?  
No! Colonel Buff'lo Bill!  
  
-Certainly this is quite a thrill, better than all the vaudeville  
-Let us be on the go and see the show with Buff'lo Bill



"I'm so amazed  
at how you take my life  
love me more, more than I deserve.  
  
"I'm blown away,  
by your power to  
change this life once lost  
and plant it in you.  
  
"And who would know  
that I was once  
on a road  
so far away from you.  
All I know is that I live my life  
to show the world your amazing love,  
Your amazing love.  
  
"Your love is so pure,  
Your love's so divine,  
Your love transforms my soul, my mind.  
Your love has the power to  
breed through hope(?)  
Amazing Love,  
amazing love.  
  
I'm so amazed, wonderful creation.  
I will live to honor you, my LORD,  
You are the gold treasure of a life,  
I will rest in you and praise eternally.

All I know is that I live my life

I'm so amazed."



Why should i feel discouraged  
Why should the shadows come  
Why should my heart feel lonely  
And long for heaven and home?  
  
When jesus is my portion  
My constant friend is he  
His eye is on the sparrow  
I know he watches me  
His eye is on the sparrow  
I know he watches me  
  
I sing because I'm happy  
I sing because I'm free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
I know he watches me  
His eye, his eye is on the sparrow  
I know he watches  
I know he watches  
I know he watches me  
  
I sing because i'm happy  
I sing because i'm free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
I know, i know, i know he watches over  
He watches over me



Well hello there gee it's been a long long time  
How am I doin' oh I guess that I'm doin' fine  
It's been so long now and it seems like it was only yesterday  
Ain't it funny how time slips away  
How's your new love I hope that she's doin' fine  
Heard you told her that you'd love her till the end of time  
Now that's the same thing that you told me seems like just the other day  
Ain't it funny how time slips away  
I gotta go now but I'll be seein' you around  
Don't know when though never know when I'll be back in town  
But remember what I told you that someday you're gonna pay  
And it's surprising how time slips away



Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid, Dark Lotus Family, It's Our World  
Lookin my crystal ball it's alright  
Welcome, my curious sisters and brothers  
First, put a twenty in the jar with the others  
(That's right take a seat)

There spirits in there  
(Whats your future, someone gonna shoot ya)  
Will you get your girlfriend back, as if I know that  
I can only tell you where your soul is headed  
And will remain eternaly embeded, the rest forget it  
Life is nothin but a test to clear  
Did you have a heart while you where here  
And was it sincere?  
Your still unraveling your future right now  
What kinda person are ya bro, oh, where there you go  
You control your own muthafuckin' destiny  
I ain't lettin' the devil get the best of me  
(I'm gonna make it into Shangri-la) golden walls  
What's up with you check your own crystal balls  
Lookin my crystal ball its allright  
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright  
  
Lookin in my crystal ball I'm seein' thugs  
Both catchin' and firin' slugs (paper for drugs)  
I see a line waiting on block cheese a mile long  
All tryin to be strong (It's the same old song)  
But when I look into everybodys faces (smile)  
Their soul are headed other places  
And they ain't worried about payin them dues down here  
(Because they mother fuckin future is crystal clear)  
The focus switches to you and it ain't good  
All mad cause someone rolls up out the neighborhood  
Check your self and the judgment was passed  
Yo, you be in hell (right up the asshole)  
It will get ya if ya let it pack your speedo's  
I hear it's hot where you headed  
I'm trying to tell ya now (when the grim reaper calls)  
You don't want to be ass out grippin' your crystal balls  
  
Lookin my crystal ball its alright  
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright  
Lookin my crystal ball its alright  
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright  
  
Look into my crystal ball its all black  
And everybodys frozen in time front to back  
Their controlled by the matrix of mind, body and soul  
And I'm branded by the system of carnival freekshow  
I see the fame analyize cause nothin is the skyz  
It's the same as seein the death in the demons eyes  
I'm high in my sights, from the truth of my crystal ball  
Believe me when I say we comin for all of y'all  
Look deep into my crystal ball  
See the dead smokin on trees and drinking alcohol  
Underneath the street beneath the concrete  
If you listen to the night you can hear my heart beat  
All painted up buried in a axe and shit  
Juggalo love got each others backs and shit  
Encased in glass for the whole world to see  
Am I inside, or is the crystal ball inside of me  
  
Lookin my crystal ball its alright  
Layback, evolve, and I'll be alright  
  
Rain comes down (Lookin my crystal ball it's alright)



Nobody loves anybody anymore, dear  
Nobody loves anybody anymore  
Life ain't what it used to be  
Or seemed to mean before  
The moon is just the moon  
The stars are only stars  
And if it don't come easy, now  
It ain't worth fighting for  
Nobody loves anybody anymore, dear.  
  
I'm back being me again  
And you're back being you  
Stronger for the loving war  
That we've been through  
We both took a look ahead  
And closed the door  
Nobody loves anybody anymore, dear  
Nobody loves anybody anymore.  
  
Maybe you believed in me  
And I believed in you  
Baby, we've been fooled before  
Everything we ever dreamed  
Ain't never ever coming true  
Nobody loves anybody anymore, dear  
Nobody loves anybody anymore.



I see thy love in the distance  
Breathless gasping for air, for in thy dreams you where  
Awakening to the bleakness in my room  
As my eyes begin to blear reality sets and starts the fear  
For do dreams come true or do I die alone  
Waiting like the petals of a wilting flower fall off  
Until there is non and the once beautiful flowers dies naked  
With no one to clothe it  
Will I hold you in the grave or will the grave hold me?  
The numbing dreams never end the swallow's wings still amongst  
The idle wind  
My colored world turns to grayscale  
Recollecting the memories eyes covered hazel  
Contradiction of thy thoughts standing calm love not lost  
Searching till I find my princess whose passionate eyes cut right through me  
For what is life if love only exists in thy thoughts?  
What is romance if it is all fiction?  
Nothing but a portrait left empty, a passing cloud of hurt  
By to meet my love in the flesh is to find my whole heart  
Your heart breaks though me your love is the key  
Longing for my hearts door  
To what day till I see sunrays shine upon your face  
I dream of you the way you look  
The beating of love in your heart  
Your wolds are like the flowing of a spring, knowing thy love  
Waits for me until eternity's end  
Is this poetry or is this love's sickness  
Engulfing my every being  
Take the heart from you and the blood ceases from me  
I see what you hear  
Breathe taking the closest thing to me and my savior  
Falling in love to a person I have never met but knowing she has salvation's
fragrance  
By God's grace this love will be free and able to fly away above  
The earth to a point of exhaustion  
But your breath will keep me alive  
Words are pointless for this love is speechless  
Preparing fro the curtains close  
Laying their clutching hands so tight I can feel your heart  
Telling me it will be all right  
Ascension to heaven wehre this love can not only walk  
But it runs through the endless fields of joy  
Where love neither ends nor begins but flows everlasting  
This was thy dream this daybreak and will by thy prayer  
That I will rest sleepless till the sun rises on that day  
And butterflies sing with us as we write love symphony  
The pages of life fill the story of our love in a time long ago  
Where fairy tales come true  
And you and I, my love, will live happily ever after  
I love you



A terrible signal  
Too weak to even recognize  
A gentle collapsing  
The removal of the insides  
  
I'm touched by your pleas  
I value these moments  
We're order than we realize  
...in someone's eyes  
  
A frequent returning  
And leaving unnoticed  
A condition of mercy  
A change in the weather  
  
A view to remember  
The center is missing  
They question how the future lies  
...in someone's eyes  
The gentle collapsing  
Of every surface  
We travel on the quiet road  
...the overload



I don't pick up the mail,  
I don't pick up the phone,  
I don't answer the door,  
I just soon be alone  
I don't keep this place up,  
I just keep the lights down,  
I don't live in these rooms,  
I just rattled around  
  
I'm just a ghost in this house,  
I'm shadow upon these walls,  
As quietly as a mouse,  
I haunt these halls,  
I'm just a whisper of smoke,  
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,  
That once burned out of control,  
You took my body and soul,  
I'm just a ghost in this house  
  
I don't care if it rains,  
I don't care if it's clear,  
I don't mind stayin' near,  
There's another ghost here,  
He sits down in your chair,  
And he shines with your light,  
And he lays down his head,  
On your pillow at night  
  
I'm just a ghost in this house,  
I'm just a shadow upon these walls,  
I'm living proof of the damage heartbreak does,  
I'm just a whisper of smoke,  
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire,  
That once burned out of control,  
You took my body and soul,  
I'm just a ghost in this house  
  
That once burned out of control,  
You took my body and soul,  
I'm just a ghost in this house



I believe in doing what I can  
In crying when I must  
In laughing when I choose  
Hey ho, if love were all  
  
I should be lonely.  
I believe the more you love a man,  
The more you give your trust,  
The more you're bound to lose.  
  
Although when shadows fall  
I think if only  
Somebody splendid really needed me  
Someone affectionate and dear  
  
Cares would be ended if I knew that he  
Wanted to have me near.  
But I believe that since my life began  
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse.  
Hey ho, if love were all.



Here making each day of the year  
Changing my life with one wave of his hand  
Nobody can deny that there's something there  
  
There running my hands through his hair  
Both of us thinking how good it can be someone is speaking  
But he doesn't know she's there  
  
I want him everywhere and if he's beside me I know I need never care  
But to love him is to meet him  
Everywhere knowing that love is to share  
  
Each one believing that love never dies watching his eyes and hoping I'm
always there  
To be here and everywhere here there and everywhere  
I want him everywhere and if he's beside me I know I need never care  
But to love him is to meet him  
  
Everywhere knowing that love is to share  
Each one believing that love never dies watching his eyes and hoping I'm
always there  
To be there and everywhere here there and everywhere



Why do I say, don't walk away  
You'll be the way your were before  
When you don't want me anymore  
  
Don't turn around, don't ever leave  
A lonely room where empty days  
Are gathering to meet me when you're gone-  
Gone- how in the world will I go on  
  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away)  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't walk away, don't say goodbye  
Don't turn around, don't let it die  
When shadows fall, when day is done  
All through the night, all of my life  
Don't walk away  
  
Is it a dream, when will it end  
When everything we've ever known  
Has ended and I'm all alone  
  
Where will I go, where will I be  
The feelings that I've never shown  
Maybe I'll find the answer when you're gone-  
Gone- how in the world will I go on  
  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away)  
  
[Chorus]



Sitting there at home, he arrived home late  
With no more blood cells to inebriate  
He lunged at her there, she fell from the couch  
He grabbed her body as he pulled her down  
She was screaming no, kicking out at him  
But he weighed a ton, she could never win  
He fell down on her like a sack of snakes  
Tears fell from her face as she cried and cried  
When there's hope, when there's fear  
What is there to say that he might hear  
You turn him down with no mistake  
Now you're leaving, the great escape  
  
She ran from the room out of their back door  
Leaving him to sleep on the front room floor  
And she walked that night to the town hall square  
She knew it was through and she didn't care  
She stood up to him, he looked down on her  
He shot the message and the messenger  
When he woke he was sick with all the shame  
Tears fell from his face as she cried and cried  
  
She arrived back home, he was on his knees  
Begging with his heart please come back to me



Look up  
Look down  
I've seen it all before  
I need emotion  
Look left  
Look right  
I've tried it all before  
I need emotion  
  
Say nothing  
It's over  
I sold my soul  
Forever  
  
She's tempting  
Sex tension  
It could be the wrong move  
  
One question  
One answer  
I don't need  
Exposure  
  
I don't know  
The slogan  
New fashion kills me  
  
Fashion  
Tear it up  
It don't mean a thing so  
Fashion  
Tear it up good  
  
Touch me  
Picture this  
It don't mean a thing so  
Touch me  
Life is cruel  
  
How did this ever get serious?  
  
One night  
One touch  
I've used them all before  
I need emotion  
  
One lie  
Too much  
I've heard it all before  
I need emotion  
  
I'll show you  
Religion  
Some people  
Disgust me  
  
Listen to  
Opinion  
I'm in a glass house  
  
'I've been sick'  
She whispers  
Abandon  
Nostalgia  
  
Remember  
My picture  
I only work here  
  
I need emotion  
  



Open wide Oh so good I'll eat you  
Take me for a ride  
In your sweet delicious  
Perfect little mouth  
Thereupon I linger  
You will have no doubt  
I'll do my best for you, I do  
Love  
Let's stop to get it going  
Lost myself just thinking  
About the two of us  
From each other drinking  
Begin with the lips  
Fingertips and kissing  
Turn me inside out  
I do my best for you  
Up and down we go  
From the top you push me  
This is such a thrill  
Lost in love and dancing  
Shake your tambourine  
You blow my head open  
Of this there's no doubt  
I do my best for you I do  
For you I would crawl  
Through the darkest dungeon  
Climb the castle wall  
If you are my Rapunzel  
You let your hair down  
Right in through your window  
Good they locked the door  
I do my best for you  
I think the world of you  
All of my heart I do  
Blood through my veins for you  
You alone have all of me  
I give my world to you  
To you I will be true  
Too good to be real  
Smell of something cooking  
My soul you're to steal  
Food of love we're filling  
What you've given me  
For it there is no measure  
Of one thing I know  
I'll give my best for you  
I think the world of you  
All of my heart I do  
Blood through my veins for you  
You alone have all of me  
From you my strength is full  
To carry your burdens too  
I give my world to you  
Hip lock up so tight  
You drive me crazy  
Crazy is all right  
With you looking at me  
You make me feel high  
Every single thing you do to me  
Is like I'm drunk  
I do my best for you, I do



I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night  
When an XKE pulled up on my right.  
He rolled down the window of his shiny, new Jag  
And challenged me then and there to a drag.  
I said, "You're on, Buddy, my mill's running fine  
Let's come of the line, now, at Sunset and Vine  
But I'll go ya one better, if you've got the nerve  
Let's race all the way ... to Deadman's Curve"  
  
CHORUS:  
Deadman's Curve--is no place to play  
Deadman's Curve--you best keep away  
Deadman's Curve--I can hear them say  
You won't come back from Deadman's Curve  
  
The street was deserted late Friday night,  
We were buggin' each other as we sat out the light  
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green  
You shoulda heard the whine from my screamin' machine  
I flew past La Brea, Schwabs, and Crescent Heights  
And all the Jag could see were my six tail lights  
He passed me at Doheny and I started to swerve  
But I pulled it out and there we were: At Deadman's curve  
  
(SPOKEN) Well, the last thing I remember, Doc, I started to swerve  
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve  
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight  
I found out for myself that everyone was right:  
  
Won't come back from Deadman's Curve!  
  
Repeat chorus and fade



The night was black with thunder  
The streets were wet with rain  
Another day goes under  
A little bourbon will take the strain  
And I'm waiting for my take-home French fries  
She smiled and said 'take me away'  
We always laughed but I think she means it  
But I'm dreaming my life away  
Loving you  
Loving you the way that I do  
  
The weekend cars are leaving  
In a spray of wind and sound  
The bar-talk, make believing  
And the drinks go easy down  
It's back to the all-night take-away  
She says 'Here comes the man of my dreams'  
We always laugh but I think she means it  
And I'm spending my time  
Just loving you  
Loving you the way that I do



I could cry salty tears  
Where have I been all these years  
A little while, tell me now  
How long has this been going on?  
  
There were chills, up and down my spine  
Yes, there're thrills I can't define  
Listen sweet, while I repeat  
How long has this been going on?  
  
Oh I could feel that I could melt  
Into heaven I'm hurled  
Oh I know how leif erickson felt  
Finding another world  
Kiss me once, and then once more  
Oh what a dunce I was before  
What a break, for heaven's sake  
How long has this been going on?  
  
Repeat last verse



Verse 1:  
The strands in your eyes  
They color them wonderful  
Stop me was stealing my breath  
The emeralds from mountains  
The thrust toward the sky  
Never revealing their depth  
Tell me  
That we belong together  
Dress it up with the trappings of love  
I'll be captivated  
I'll hang from your lips  
Instead of the gallows of heartbreak  
That hang from above  
  
Chorus:  
And i'll be you're crying shoulder  
I'll be love suicide  
And i'll be better when I'm older  
I'll be the greatest fan of your life  
(x2)  
  
Verse 2:  
I've dropped out  
I've bearned up  
I've fought my way back from the dead  
I've turned in  
I've turned on  
I've saw all of the things I've said  
  
Repeat Chorus



Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains,  
And they ain't the kind, that you can see  
Whoa, these chains of love,  
Got a hold on me, yeah  
  
Chains, well I can't break away from these chains,  
Can't run around 'cause I'm not free  
Whoa, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah  
  
I want to tell you pretty baby,  
I think you're fine  
I'd like to love you, but,  
Darling, I'm imprisoned by these  
  
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains,  
And they ain't the kind, that you can see  
Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me, yeah  
  
Please believe me when I tell you, your lips are sweet  
I'd like to kiss them but I can't break away from all these  
  
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains,  
And they ain't the kind that you can see  
Whoa, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah  
  
Chains, chains of love  
Chains of love  
Chains of love



Sometimes I get the feelin'  
I was back in the old days-long ago  
When we were kids, when we were young  
Things seemed so perfect-you know?  
Thedays were endless, we were crazy-we were young  
The sun was always shinin'-we just lived for fun  
Sometimes ot seems like lately-I don't know  
The rest of my life's been-just a show  
  
Those were the days of our lives  
The bad things in life were so few  
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true-  
When I look and find, I still love you  
  
You can't turn back the clock,  
You can't turn back the tide  
Ain't that a shame? (ain't that a shame?)  
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride  
When life was just a game  
No use sitting and thinkin' on what you did  
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids  
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know  
Better sit back and go-with the flow  
  
'cause these are the days of our lives  
They've flown in the swiftness of time  
These days are all gone now but some things remain  
When I look and I find-no change  
  
Those were the days of our lives  
The bad things in life were so few  
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true-  
When I look and find, I still love you  
  
I still love you  
I love you  
I still love you  
I still love you  
I still love you  
Still love you



A frosty Christmas Eve, when the stars where shining,  
I traveled for the home, where westward falls the hill.  
And for many, many a village, in the darkness of the valley,  
distant music reached me, peels of bells were ringing.  
  
Then spread my thoughts to olden times, to that first of Christmases  
when shepherds who were watching, heard music in the fields.  
And they sat there and they marveled, and they knew they could not tell  
whether it were angels, or the bright stars a singing.  
  
But to me heard a far, it was starry music,  
the singing of the angels, the comfort of our Lord.  
Words of old that come a traveling, by the riches of the times,  
and I softly listened, as I stood upon the hill.  
And I softly listened, as I stood upon the hill.



If you're wondering why  
All the love that you long for eludes you  
And people are rude and cruel to you  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
You just haven't earned it, son  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
You must suffer and cry for a longer time  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
And I'm telling you now...  
  
If you're wondering why  
When all I wanted from life was to be famous  
I have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
But you wouldn't believe me  
  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
You just haven't earned it, son  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
You must suffer and cry for a longer time  
You just haven't earned it yet, Baby  
And I'm telling you now...  
I'll tell you why  
I'll tell you why  
  
Today I am remembering the time  
When they pulled me back  
And held me down  
And looked me in the eyes and said  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
You just haven't earned it, my son  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
You must stay on your own for slightly longer  
You just haven't earned it yet baby  
And I'm telling you now...  
  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
Oh...  
You just haven't earned it yet, baby  
Oh...  
Oh



Country roads,take me home  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
Take me home,country roads  
  
Almost heaven,West Virginia  
Blue Ridge Mountain,Shenandoe River  
Life is old there,older than the trees  
Younger than the mountains  
  
Growing like the breeze  
Country roads,take me home  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
  
Take me home,country roads  
All my memories gather round her  
Mine is lady,stranger to blue water  
Dark and dusty painted on the sky  
  
Misty taste of moonshine  
Teardrop in my eye  
Country roads,take me home  
To the place I belong  
  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
Take me home,country roads  
I hear her voice in the morning  
Now she calls me  
  
The radio reminds me of my home far away  
And driving down the road I get a feeling  
That I should've been home yesterday,yesterday  
Country roads,take me home  
  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
Take me home,country roads  
Country roads,take me home  
  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
Take me home,country roads  
Take me home,country roads



He arrived on the scene  
With no past and no future  
He seemed to know your dreams  
Replace tears with laughter  
  
Street corner whispers  
Would mention his name  
Selfish? Benevolent?  
What was his game  
  
Some say he's perfect  
Some say a spy  
A hidden power  
They all wonder why  
The rumors mounted  
But still no fact?  
I need to find out  
Some say perfect hidden power  
We all wonder why  
  
Questions unanswered  
Suspicion alerted  
I went round to his place  
If felt quite deserted  
I climbed the stairs to where  
His body lay without motion  
No spirit lives in there  
The cord had been broken  
  
His skin was reptile  
No life in there  
Not young not old  
A long hollow glare  
His breath had stopped  
No hearts beat there  
Is this a man  
Should I believe hidden power  
They all wondered why  
  
My attention was caught  
By a sound from the door  
Panic gripped the mind  
What lay in store  
A being stared at me  
Benevolent, not cold  
Automaton - he is controlled  
  
His skin was reptile.....  
  
Automaton - no life in there  
No past and no future  
Is this a man  
Automaton - no life in there  
No past and not future  
Is this a man



Reality reality reality is always  
You tattooed yourself what a piece of art  
You've already broken your mother's heart  
When I was your age working my ass off  
Your generation's soft  
  
Reality is always such a drag  
For barely blooming eighteens  
The barely blooming eighteen  
Wants to know  
  
What's keeping her from searching  
You cannot pierce that and  
You're dressed too tight  
  
Got a lot to learn about wrong and right  
So dye you hair, dad's gonna wash it out  
Come on wash out your mouth  
  
Reality is always such a drag  
For barely blooming eighteens  
The barely blooming eighteen  
Wants to know  
  
What's hiding in the shadow  
Reality reality reality is always  
Reality is always

Maybe she was smilin' in the mirror  
Maybe I was too, 'cause I was stoned  
Singin' every sad song on the juke-box one more time  
Honey, they were hittin' close to home  
  
And I said - Maybe this'll make you think I'm crazy  
Honey, don't feel lonesome if you do  
But if you wanna make a young man happy one more time  
I'd sure like to spend the night with you  
  
And she said - Stranger  
Shut out the light and lead me  
Somewhere - shut out the shadows, too  
And while we lay there, makin' believe you love me  
Stranger, could I believe in you  
  
Maybe you got all you got together  
Maybe you keep rollin' like a stone  
Maybe some old lonesome song'll take you by surprise  
And leave you just a little more alone  
  
Singing - Stranger  
Shut out the light and lead me  
Somewhere - shut out the shadows, too  
And while we lay there, makin' believe you love me  
Stranger, could I believe in you  
  
Keep Singing - Stranger  
Shut out the light and lead me  
Somewhere - shut out the shadows, too  
And while we lay there, makin' believe you love me  
Stranger, could I believe in you  



Out on the wiley, windy moors, we'd roll and fall in green  
You had a temper like my jealousy, too hot, too gready  
How could you leave me, when I needed to possess you  
I hated you, I loved you too  
Bad dreams in the night  
You told me I was going to lose the fight  
Leave behind my  
  
Wuthering, wuthering, wuthering heights  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
I'm - so cold, let me in your window  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
I'm - so cold, let me in your window  
  
Ooh, it gets dark, it gets lonely  
On the other side from you  
I pine a lot, I find the lot falls through without you  
I'm coming back love, cruel heathcliff  
My one dream, my only master  
  
Too long I roam in the night  
I'm coming back to his side to put it right  
I'm coming home to  
  
Wuthering, wuthering, wuthering heights  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
I'm - so cold, let me in your window  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
I'm - so cold, let me in your window  
  
Ooh, let me have it, let me grab your soul away  
Ooh, let me have it, let me grab your soul away  
You know it's me, cathy  
  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
I'm - so cold, let me in your window  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
I'm - so cold, let me in your window  
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm cathy, I've come home  
So cold

I know these streets and these backyards,  
This barn that's falling down.  
We come to where they're building now  
And ride our bikes around.  
  
And you think I'm just a little kid,  
Some troubles on the way.  
Well, I knew this place before you did  
Is all I've got to say.  
  
I'm only walking  
Through these streets and all around.  
I'm only walking.  
I know this town.  
  
We come home through these fields at night  
About a million times.  
I'd walk the road with my eyes closed  
And all the paths besides.  
  
And I know the boy who broke this fence,  
And I know his brother, too.  
And they'd never give me half a chance  
If I let on to you.  
  
I'm only walking  
Through these streets and all around.  
I'm only walking.  
I know this town.  
I know this town.  
  
We dam the streams, we raid the shacks,  
And hide in boxcars on the tracks.  
We know these quarries in our sleep  
And where they're cold and where they're deep.  
  
I'll go down to the bowling alley  
And buy smokes and Dentyne.  
I find some loose change every day  
Under that Coke machine.  
  
You check me out as you drive by  
Like there was some big deal.  
Well I know so much you'll never find  
From there behind the wheel.  
  
I'm only walking  
Through these streets and all around.  
I'm only walking.  
I know this town.  
I know this town.  
I know this town.  
I know this town.



Slightly drunk once again  
All alone with my pen  
I thought I'd write to you  
How can I say how I feel ?  
Falling down on a deal  
This last night with you  
Is it the cold that makes me shake?  
I just hope that I'm awake  
I say alright I knew  
(I knew)  
  
[CHORUS:]  
I was wrong you were right  
(That's a line I cannot find)  
I could not say goodbye  
(to explain just why I lied)  
Why's it always feel the same?  
(slightly drunk what you said to me)  
I'm in love once again  
(can't fall in love without misery)  
  
I'm pretty sad but so what?  
I should be glad but I'm not  
I'm confused once more  
All tangled up in your love  
Without it now so that's tough  
My heart cries for  
  
A little talk to anger me  
Out on the road especially  
Back to you once more  
(once more)  
  
[CHORUS ]  
Slightly drunk once again  
All alone without friends  
Had it all, I know I lied  
All my ends seem untied  
I cannot say how I feel



Started at the age of four  
My mother went to the grocery store  
Went sneaking through her bedroom door  
To find something in a size four  
  
Sugar and spice and everything nice  
Wasn't made for only girls  
GI Joe in panty hose is making room  
For the one and only  
  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
King for a day in a leather thong  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me  
  
My daddy threw me in therapy  
He thinks I'm not a real man  
Who put the drag in the drag queen  
Don't knock it until you tried it  
  
Sugar and spice and everything nice  
Wasn't made for only girls  
GI Joe in panty hose is making room  
For the one and only  
  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
King for a day in a leather thong  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me  
  
Sugar and spice and everything nice  
Wasn't made for only girls  
GI Joe in panty hose is making room  
For the one and only  
  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
King for a day in a leather thong  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
King for a day in a leather thong  
  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
King for a day in a leather thong  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
Just wait 'til all the guys, just wait 'til all the guys  
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me



Sunset on the highway to old mexico  
Ruby like the wind upon my face  
Thunder from a storm on the horizon far away  
Ruby cut directly to the chase  
She said,  
"anywhere you're going baby  
You just gotta know I'm on your side. (I always was)  
When you climb upon the stallion  
You are bound to let him take you for a ride  
All the way."  
Chorus:  
I know I'm still wild enough for you  
And you know you, you can always count on me  
Baby, we used to be worth fighting for  
So tell me, are we?  
Anything like anything we used to be  
Or tried to make believe before the fall?  
Tell me how the hell you keep your spirit (remember spirit? )  
Strong enough to answer to the call  
Ruby closed her eyes and faced the heavens  
She said, "take me to the stars one more time"  
I was doin' eighty, but I pushed her through the floor  
And watched her climb  
Outta sight, outta mind  
Chorus:  
I know I'm still wild enough for you  
And you know you, you can always count on me  
Baby, we used to be worth fighting for  
So tell me, are we?  



Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette  
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare  
Sotto il cielo di Roma  
  
Down each avenue or via, street or strata  
You can seeem disappearing two by two  
On an evening in Roma  
Do they take 'em for espresso, yeah, I guess so  
On each lovers arm a girl I wish I knew  
On an evening in Roma  
  
Though there's grinning and mandolining in sunny Italy  
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down  
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa  
I am only one and that's one too few, on an evening in Roma  
  
Don't know what the country's coming to  
But in Rome do as the Romans do  
Will you on an evening in Roma  
  
Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette  
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare  
Sotto il cielo di Roma  
Don't know what the country's coming to  
But in Rome do as the Romans do  
Will you on an evening in Roma  
Sotter celo de Roma, on an evening in Roma



A man can only last so long.  
Before temptation gets too strong.  
But I'm doin' all I know to do.  
To try and stay away from you.  
You got me right on the Borderline.  
  
[Chorus]  
Borderline.  
Don't let me cross over.  
She's right behind me in the moonlight.  
Lord knows I've tried to think of my lover.  
Borderline.  
Don't let me cross her tonight.  
  
You know I got a woman at home.  
That I sure hate to leave alone.  
But still you just keep comin' on like I'm not made of flesh and bone.  
You got me right on the Borderline.  
  
Promises are easy made.  
In the heat of passion, light of day.  
But let that daylight start to fade and your best laid plans might get mis-
layed.  
When you're right on the Borderline.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Borderline. Don't let me cross her tonight.



And after many hours,  
We don't know where we're going,  
I fear it's destination zero  
And it's so hard to please you,  
To say the words that ease you.  
But I will always go my own way  
This was already known  
But never really shown  
I know it''s destination zero  
But have you really tried,  
I know that I was I  
But now I'm falling even harder  
And you fall and you cry and you want me to die  
Everything comes down on me  
Despite of this you look so good to me  
And you fall and you cry and you want me to die  
Everything comes down on me  
Despite of this you look so good to me  
Wave me goodbye  
Save me tonight  
Take me away  
Just turn it around  
And you fall and you cry and you want me to die  
Everything comes down on me  
Despite of this you look so good to me  
And you fall and you cry and you want me to die  
Everything comes down on me  
Despite of this you look so good to me  
Good to me  
Good to me

Someday you're gonna wake up singing  
Someday you're gonna wake up tired  
It makes you feel like a horseshoe  
In a swimming pool  
Cause you know you don't belong  
I move left  
You move right  
I'm like a blind man on a motorbike  
You say potato  
But I say pie  
Tell me why  
Someday you'll be sorry  
Someday sad  
Someday you might even wake up  
Just a little bit mad  
Maybe tomorrow  
Might be tonight  
But in the meantime.  
I was hoping you might  
Solve this puzzle of mine  
Someday

Congratulations!  
Oh, seems like you've done it again,  
And  
I ain't had such misery since  
I don't know when,  
Oh, and I don't know when,  
Oh, and I don't know when.  
  
I notice so many people slippin' away,  
And many more waiting in the lines  
In the courtrooms today,  
Oh, in the courtrooms today.  
  
Love is not a game,  
Love is not a toy,  
Love's no romance.  
Love will do you in, and love will wash you out,  
And needless to say you won't stand a chance,  
And you won't stand a chance.  
  
I'm hungry for learnin',  
Won't you answer me, please.  
Can a man and a woman live together in peace,  
Oh, live together in peace?



Day after day I'm more confused  
When I look for the light in the pouring rain  
I know that's a game that I hate to lose  
And I'm feeling the strength  
Ain't it a shame  
[Chorus:]  
Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Oh.. Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Beginning to think that I'm wasting time  
I don't understand the things I do  
The world outside looks so un-kind  
I'm countin' on you  
To carry me through... Oh...  
Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Yeah!.. Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
When my mind is free  
You know a melody can move me  
When I'm feeling blue  
The guitar is coming through to soothe me...  
Thanks for the joy that your giving me  
I want you to know I believe in your song  
Rythem and Rhyme and Harmony  
You've helped me along  
Making me strong.... Oh!...  
(Acapalla)  
Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Oh.... Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Oh... Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Now, now, now, wont ya  
Wont ya take me, oh... Take me



'Bang!' goes another kanga

Where has my love gone?  
How can I go on?  
It seems dear love has gone away.  
Where is my spirit?  
I'm nowhere near it,  
Oh yes, my love has gone astray.  
But Ill blame it on the sun,  
The sun that didn't shine,  
Ill blame it on the wind and the trees.  
Ill blame it on the time that never was enough,  
Ill blame it on the tide and the sea,  
But, my heart blames it on me.  
Who poured the love out?  
What made this bitter doubt?  
Is peace not here for me to see?  
Wish I could tell you,  
But, words won't come for me to speak.  
But Ill blame it on the sun,  
That didn't fill the sky,  
Ill blame it on the birds and the trees.  
Ill blame it on the day that ended once too soon,  
Ill blame it on the nights that could not be,  
But, my heart blames it on me.  
(background)...yeh, yeh, yeh, ooh,  
Your heart blames it on you this time.  
  



We're going on a holiday now  
Gonna take a villa, a small chalet  
On the Costa del Magnifico  
Where the cost of living is so low  
Yeah, we're gonna be so neat  
Dance to the Eurobeat  
Yeah, we're gonna be so cool  
Twisting by the pool  
  
Sitting in a small cafe now  
Swing, swing, swinging to the cabaret  
You want to see a movie, take in a show now  
Meet new people at the disco  
Yeah, we're gonna be so neat  
Dance to the Eurobeat  
Yeah, we're gonna be so cool  
Twisting by the pool  
  
And we can still get information  
Reading all about inflation  
And you're never gonna be out of reach  
There's a call-box on the beach  
  
Mmm, you're gonna look so cute  
Sunglasses and a bathing suit  
Be the baby of my dreams  
Like the ladies in the magazines  
Yeah, we're gonna be so neat  
Dance to the Eurobeat  
Yeah, we're gonna be so cool  
Twisting by the pool  
  
I'm a twisting fool  
Just twisting, yeah, twisting  
Twisting by the pool



Take good care of what you've got  
My father said to me  
As he puffed his pipe and baby B.  
He dandled on his knee  
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away  
Keep all good company  
Oo hoo oo hoo  
Take care of those you call your own  
And keep good company  
  
Soon I grew and happy too  
My very good friends and me  
We'd play all day with Sally J.  
The girl from number four  
Very soon I begged her won't you  
Keep me company  
Oo hoo oo hoo  
Oo hoo oo hoo  
Come marry me for evermore we'll  
Be good company  
  
Now marriage is an institution sure  
My wife and I our needs and nothing more  
All my friends by a year  
By and by disappeared  
But we're safe enough behind our door  
  
I flourished in my humble trade  
My reputation grew  
The work devoured my waking hours  
But when my time was through  
Reward of all my efforts my own  
Limited company  
  
I hardly noticed Sally as we  
Parted company  
All through the years in the end it appears  
There was never really anyone but me  
  
Now I'm old, I puff my pipe  
But no-one's there to see  
I ponder on the lesson of  
My life's insanity  
Take care of those you call your own  
And keep good company



The sheets won't need changing everyday  
The freezer supply should last a year  
Those hidden little points that you're away  
Nothing much has changed since you were here  
  
Our paths will cross some day  
Our paths will cross some day  
While you're out jogging and I'm sat snogging  
Some fool on a lakeside bench  
  
And when she calls I hope it's you that dials  
I hope it's you that feels this love inside  
And when I touch her I hope it's you that smiles  
And when I die I hope it's you I'm beside  
To die with her would be a worthless lie  
To die with her would be a worthless die  
To die together would be worth a try  
To die together would be worth a try  
  
The family pack seems larger than it should  
Two for one's no good when there's just one  
I'd raise a bigger smile if I could  
But me minus you equals none  
  
Our paths will cross some day  
Our paths will cross some day  
When you're out fishing and I'm sat wishing  
  
You instead of him  
Our paths will cross some day  
Our paths will cross some day  
When you're out exercising and I'm there prising  
The pants of I my latest sin  
  
And when we kiss she knows it's you I kiss  
'Cause when we kiss I always start to cry  
You just can't cover up these lying lips  
When I die I hope it's you I'm beside  
To die with her would be a worthless lie  
To die with her would be a worthless die  
To die together would be worth a try  
To die together would be worth a try  
  
An ambulance flashed past me in the street  
Just yards from where we were to meet  
I was half hoping you were dead meat  
That it was you that was under the sheet  
  
And as you lay there alone in the ward  
Fumbling for the keys to death's door  
At least I'd have summoned up the nerve  
To whisper you these words  
  
Finally! Quietly! Actually!  
I love you!



Don't haunt me  
Don't haunt me  
  
Gather up the lost and sold  
Into your arms  
Into your arms  
  
Gather up the pitiful  
In your arms  
In your arms  
In your arms  
In your arms  
  
What seems impossible  
In your arms  
In your arms  
  
I think I have had my fill  
In your arms  
In your arms  
In your arms  
In your arms  
  
I've think I should give up the ghost  
Into your arms  
Into your arms



Muhammad my friend  
It's time to tell the world  
We both know it was a girl  
Back in Bethlehem  
And on that fateful day  
When she was crucified  
She wore Shiseido Red  
And we drank tea by her side  
  
Sweet sweet  
Used to be so sweet to me  
  
Muhammad my friend  
I'm getting very scared  
Teach me how to love  
My brothers who don't know the law  
And what about the deal  
On the flying trapeze  
Got a peanut butter hand  
But honey do drop in  
At the Dew Drop Inn  
  
Sweet sweet  
Between the boys and the bees  
  
Moses I know  
I know you've seen the fire  
But you've never seen fire  
Until you've seen Pele blow  
And I've never seen light  
But I sure have seen gold  
And Gladys save a place for me on your grapevine  
Till I get my own TV show  
Ashre ashre ashre ashre  
And if I lose my Cracker Jacks at the tidal wave  
I got a place in the Pope's rubber robe  
  
Muhammad my friend  
It's time to tell the world  
We both know it was a girl  
Back in Bethlehem

And she'll get it (ohhhhhhh)  
When I say girl  
(Hook)

In this life  
Wondering why

I'd rather the bitter truth  
When it comes to you  
Than those sweet lies  
Lies (sweet lies)  
(Verse Two)  
Why oh why this song  
Don't you love me (I love you, put that on everything)  
Well maybe where I went wrong

Then I'm out  
I'm out to night  
You'll see  
(Verse 3)  
I bet it was sweet on your lips  
When you told me (let me show you)  
Ayay (it hurt me)  
My heart is just twisting slowly  
(I let you do) no one to hold me  
(B-Section)

Sitting in the cheap seats underneath  
The stars  
I'm heading back to base, I'll drop you off  
At Mars  
I'm sure I know your face or what star  
You're from  
I try to make conversation but I'm too  
Far gone  
  
I'm a man machine  
Drinking gasoline  
Super human being  
Shooting laser beams  
  
How you gonna leave, when your bags  
Ain't packed  
And how you gonna shoot, when we're  
Back to back  
How d'you tell a joke, when you can't laugh  
You know that you're the punchline, baby  
Take a bath  
  
I'm a man machine  
Drinking gasoline  
Super human being  
I'm a queen's dream  
  
The dog has ate my homework today  
It's not done, it ain't done  
I have heard they're not very well  
In the sun  
  
Cos I'm a man machine  
I'm a queen's dream  
Drinking gasoline  
I'm a queen's dream  
  
Yeah....Help  
  
How you gonna live for love lying on  
Your back  
And how you gonna keep it kleen in a  
Dirty mac  
How you gonna breathe when you're lost  
In space  
You're dazed and amused  
Talking through a different face  
  
Cos I'm man machine  
Drinking gasoline  
I'm a teen dream  
I'm a man machine  
I'm a man machine  
I'm a man machine  
Drinking gasoline  



It was you who walked into my life  
You were the one  
You hear my cries of loneliness  
Through my cool cautious eyes  
Can't you see me reaching out for you  
Can't you feel me there  
Wont you please believe me  
I could never touch you for the fear  
That I might never let you go  
  
It was you with the courage and the commitment  
To start your new life  
You make me believe in mine  
But can't you see the confusion  
Through my troubled smile  
I'm torn between losing me  
Losing me and gaining you  
  
Maybe I've been distant  
Maybe I've been cold  
But I've done it for my own existence  
And I do believe I do believe its getting old  
  
I might never say that I love you  
I might never say I care  
But I will tell you now  
That Ill always be there



I can't forget you  
I've got these memories of you  
I can't forget you  
I'll always be loving you  
  
Once we were happy  
We were so carefree and gay  
Then something happened  
And you went away  
  
I can't forget you  
Please tell me what must I do  
My memories haunt me  
Because I'll always love you  
  
Where are you darlin'  
Are you with someone new  
I can't forget you  
I'll always be loving you  
  
I can't forget you  
I've got these memories of you  
I can't forget you  
I'll always be loving you  
  
I can't forget you  
Please tell me what must I do  
My memories haunt me  
Because I'll always love you  
  
Where are you darlin'  
Are you with someone new  
I can't forget you  
I'll always be loving you



[Verse 1]  
Enemy, used to be  
Part of you, bittersweet  
But now you tell me lies  
Up and down, cold and hot  
Swear to God, got to stop  
Because I can't sleep at night  
  
[Refrain]  
If you wanted love like this  
Blowing up with every kiss  
Should've known better  
Because you find yourself alone  
Chilling you right to the bone  
No, should've known better  
  
[Chorus]  
You and me just  
Running towards the light  
Giving up the fight  
Hoping we survive  
You and me just  
Strangers in the night  
Giving up the fight  
Waiting to ignite  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
  
[Verse 2]  
Lost in you, lost in me  
Afraid of love, in too deep  
So we just run and hide  
Lightning fast, felt the crash  
Scared to lose, fear attacks  
We only know goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
You and me just  
Running towards the light  
Giving up the fight  
Hoping we survive  
You and me just  
Strangers in the night  
Giving up the fight  
Waiting to ignite  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
  
[Refrain]  
If you wanted love like this  
Blowing up with every kiss  
Should've known better  
Because you find yourself alone  
Chilling you right to the bone  
No, should've known better  
  
[Bridge]  
Hopelessly holding on  
To all those perfect nights  
Let's pretend it's not gone  
And say we'll never die  
  
[Chorus]  
You and me just  
Running towards the light  
Giving up the fight  
Hoping we survive  
You and me just  
Strangers in the night  
Giving up the fight  
Waiting to ignite  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
Holding on for life  
  
[Outro]  
Hopelessly holding on  
To all those perfect nights  
Let's pretend it's not gone  
And say we'll never die  
Say we'll never die



Today I find all my world is slowly turning blue  
How about you  
I walk around with my head in the sky and it is blue  
How about you  
Today I find all the things I held so high are in the ground  
I don't know why, I don't know where  
I don't know why you really care  
I only know that my world's turning blue  
How about, how about you  
Today I see a million faces in shades of fading blue  
How about you  
I felt so sure familiar places and children's skies are blue  
How about you  
Today I find all the things I held so high are in the ground  
I don't know why, I don't know where  
I don't know why you really care  
I only know that my world's turning blue  
How about, how about you  
I don't know why, I don't know where  
I don't know why you really care  
I only know that my world's turning blue  
How about, how about you  
I don't know why, I don't know where  
I don't know why you really care  
I only know that my world's turning blue  
How about, how about you  



A little girl prayed at the close of the day,  
Cause her daddy had gone far away,  
On her little face was a look of despair,  
I stood there and listened, and I heard this prayer  
My Mommie says daddy has brought us to shame  
And I'm never no more to mention his name  
Lord take me and lead me and hold to my hand  
Oh heavenly father help me understand  
  
You know friends I wonder  
Just how many homes are broken tonight  
And just how many tears are shed  
By some little word of anger  
That never should have been said  
  
I'd like to tell you a story  
Of a family I once knew.  
We'll call them Mary and William  
And their little daughter sue  
  
Now Mary was just a plain mother  
And bill was just a usual dad  
And they had their little family quarrels  
(Like everybody else)  
But neither one really got mad  
  
Then one day something happened  
It was nothing of course  
But one word led to another  
And the last word led to a divorce  
  
Now here were two grown up people  
Who failed to use common sense  
They strengthened their own selfish pride  
At little Sue's expense  
  
You know she didn't ask to be brought to  
This world  
To drift from pillar to post  
But a divorce never stops to consider  
The ones it hurts the most  
  
There'd be a lot more honest loving  
In this wicked ole world today  
If just a few parted parents  
Could hear little sue say  
  
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand  
Oh heavenly father, help me understand



I don't know if you can hear me  
Or if you're even there  
I don't know if you would listen  
To a humble prayer  
Yes, I know I'm just an outcast  
I shouldn't speak to you  
Still I see your face and wonder  
Were you once an outcast too  
  
I ask for nothing  
I can get by  
But I know so many  
Less lucky than I  
God help the outcasts  
The poor and down trod  
I thought we all were  
The children of God  
  
I don't know if there's a reason  
  
Why some are blessed, some not  
Why the few you seem to favour  
They fear us  
Flee us  
Try not to see us  
  
God help the outcasts  
The tattered the torn  
Seeking an answer  
To why they were born  
Winds of misfortune  
Have blown them about  
You made the outcasts  
Don't cast them out  
  
The poor and unlucky  
The weak and the odd  
I thought we all were  
The children of  
God...



Moon river  
Wider than a mile  
I'll be crossing you in style  
Someday  
  
Oh, dream maker  
You heartbreaker  
Wherever you're going  
I'm going your way  
  
Two drifters  
Off to see the world  
I'm not so sure the world  
Deserves us  
  
We're after  
The same rainbow's end  
How come it's just around the bend ?  
It's always just around the bend ?  
  
Moon river  
Wider than a mile  
I'll be crossing you in style  
Someday  
  
Oh, dream maker  
You heartbreaker  
Wherever you're going

Two drifters  
Off to see the world  
I'm not so sure the world  
Deserves us  
  
We're after  
The same rainbow's end  
It's just around the bend  
It's just around the bend  
It's just around the bend  
It's just around the bend  
  
Oh!



Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
Madam,  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
She is sorry to be delayed,  
But last night down in Lover's Lane she strayed,  
Madam,  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
  
When she woke up and found  
That her dream of love was gone,  
Madam,  
She ran to the man  
Who had led her so far astray,  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her lover down,  
Madam,  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
  
When the mob came and got her  
And dragged her from the jail,  
Madam,  
They strung her upon  
The old willow across the way,  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her head and cried,  
Madam,  
"Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today."



You'll meet many just like me upon lifes busy street.  
With shoulders stooped and heads bowed low and eyes that stare in defeat.  
For souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts,  
For a living death is all that's left for men with brokens hearts.  
You have no right to be the judge, to criticize and condemn.  
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him.  
One careless step, a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts  
And to those who weep death comes cheap, these men with broken hearts.  
  
Humble you should be when they come passing by,  
For it's written that the greatest of men never get to big to cry.  
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts,  
With hope all gone, they walk alone these men with broken hearts.  
You've never walked in that man's shoes or saw things through his eyes,  
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies.  
  
Some were paupers, some were kings, some were masters of the arts,  
But in their shame they're all the same, these men with broken hearts.  
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death.  
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath?  
So help your brother along the road, no matter where he starts!  
For the God that made you, made them too. These men with broken hearts!



I can go anyway (way I choose)  
I can live anyhow (win or lose)  
I can go anywhere (for something new)  
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose  
  
I can do anything (right or wrong)  
I can talk anyhow (and get along)  
I don't care anyway (I never lose)  
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose  
  
Nothing gets in my way  
Not even locked doors  
Don't follow the lines that been laid before  
I get along anyway I care  
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere  
  
I can go anyway (way I choose)  
I can live anyhow (win or lose)  
I can go anywhere (for something new)  
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose  
  
Anyway, anyway I choose  
I wanna go  
Do it myself, do it myself, do it myself, do it myself  
Anyway, anyway I choose



Let's talk of peace,  
Sounds so cliche  
A novelty,  
Catch phrase of the day  
Middle, index,  
Sign of the time  
Just as complex,  
As water to  
  
Someone said  
Give peace a chance  
And, that's all that we're saying  
While we're sitting  
On the fence  
Pretending,  
Our hearts are in the right place  
But, your face  
Shows a trace of  
  
Hypocrisy,  
Don't tread on me,  
Now you can see  
  
Make love not war,  
Sounds so absurd, to me  
We can't afford  
To say these words, lightly  
Or else our world  
Will truly, rest in peace  
  
Let's not pretend,  
To justify  
Rather amend,  
Where treasures lie  
Straight through the heart,  
Peace can be found  
That's where you start,  
Not all around  
  
Someone said  
Give peace a chance  
And, that's all that we're saying  
While we're sitting  
On the fence  
Pretending,  
Our hearts are in the right place  
But, your face  
Shows a trace of  
  
Hypocrisy,  
Don't tread on me, boy  
Now you can see



You've got to accentuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
Latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with Mister In-Between  
  
You've got to spread joy up to the maximum  
Bring gloom down to the minimum  
Have faith or pandemonium  
Liable to walk upon the scene  
  
To illustrate his last remark  
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark  
What did they do  
Just when everything looked so dark  
  
Man, they said we better, accentuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
Latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with Mister In-Between  
No, do not mess with Mister In-Between  
Do you hear me?  
  
Oh, listen to me children and-a you will hear  
About the elininatin' of the negative  
And the accent on the positive  
And gather 'round me children if you're willin'  
And sit tight while I start reviewin'  
The attitude of doin' right  
  
You've gotta accentuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
Latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with Mister In-Between  
  
You've got to spread joy up to the maximum  
Bring gloom, down to the minimum  
Otherwise pandemonium  
Liable to walk upon the scene  
  
To illustrate my last remark  
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark  
What did they say  
Say when everything looked so dark  
  
Man, they said we better accentuate the positive  
Eliminate the negative  
Latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with Mister In-Between  
No, don't mess with Mister In-Between



What got into you got into me too  
What came over you is coming over me  
I've had enough of all the old stuff  
I saw the writing on the wall on my TV  
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah, oh yeah  
It's another second coming, like it or not  
You better start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God

Everybody can be famous for a day  
From shore to shore, a big department store  
Is all that's left of the American way  
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah, oh yeah  
Well, it's another second coming, like it or not  
You better start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start praying to a new, new God  
Start praying, what are you afraid of  
Start praying to a new  
There's a big world  
In the street outside  
In their uniform of pride  
And they've all come  
To see a star from the east  
Is he man or beast? Decide  
Feel like I'm crucified, still I'm not satisfied  
The second coming is coming anyway  
I see them pray for more on every dance floor  
I hear the word go out across the milky way  
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah, oh yeah  
It's another second coming, like it or not  
You better start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God

Start praying, praying on the freeway  
Start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying at the back door  
Start praying to a new, new God  
Start praying, praying on the dance floor  
Start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start swaying to a new, new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start swaying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start praying  



There's a reason  
For the sunshine day,  
There's a reason  
Why I'm feelin' so high.  
  
Must be the season  
When that love light shines all around us.  
So let that feeling  
Grad you deep inside  
  
And send you reeling  
Where your love can't hide  
And then go stealing  
Through the summer nights  
  
With your lover.  
Just let your love flow  
Like a mountain stream  
And let your love grow  
  
With the smallest of dreams  
And let your love show  
And you'll know what I mean  
It's the season.  
  
Let your love fly  
Like a bird on the wing  
And let your love bind you  
To all living things,  
  
And let your love shine  
And you'll know what I mean,  
That's the reason.  
There's a reason  
  
For the warm sweet nights  
There's a reason  
For the candle lights.  
Must be the season  
  
When those love rites shine all around us.  
So let the wonder  
Take you into space  
And lay you under  
  
Its loving embrace  
Feel the thunder  
As it warms your face  
You can't hold back.  
  
Just let your love flow  
Like a mountain stream  
And let your love grow  
With the smallest of dreams  
  
And let your love show  
And you'll know what I mean  
It's the season.  
Let your love fly  
  
Like a bird on the wing  
And let your love bind you  
To all living things,  
And let your love shine  
  
And you'll know what I mean,  
That's the reason.



Well, the rain was a-failin'  
And the ground turned to mud  
I was watching all the people  
Running from the flood  
So I starred to payin'  
Though I ain't no prayin' man  
For the lord to come a helpin'  
Knowing he'd understand  
  
Deliver your children to the good good life  
Give'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife  
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night  
And if a thing goes wrong you'd better make it right  
  
Well, I had a woman  
She was good and clean  
She spent all day with the washing machine  
But when it come to lovin'  
She was never around  
She was out getting dirty  
All over town  
  
Deliver your children to the good good life  
Give'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife  
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night  
And if a thing goes wrong you'd better make it right  
  
Well, I was low on money  
And my truck broke down  
I was on my way to the lost and found  
So I took it to a dealer  
I said make it run  
Well, I ain't got no money  
But I got me a gun  
  
I said you robbed me before  
So I'm robbing you back  
And if it don't put you straight  
It'll put you on the right track  
Well, I ain't no devil and I ain't no saint  
But I can tell a dealer by the colour of his paint  
  
Deliver your children to the good good life  
Give'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife  
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night  
And if a thing goes wrong you'd better make it right  
  
If you want good eggs  
You gotta feed that hen  
And if you wanna hear some more  
Well, I'll sing it again.



Teacher caught me masturbating underneath the desk  
She looked at me and winked her eye said "see you after class"  
I heard the school bell ring that told me that the day was done  
She called me back and locked the door my lessons just begun

To study or to play

Baby I wanna tell you all my hopes and dreams and fears  
But I'm watching television, could you get me another beer  
There's wrestling and pro football on, I hope you understand  
I must watch it all for I am a man  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And a man he perspires  
'Til the stains show on his shirt  
I missed our anniverary and the birth of our son  
It was beyond my control, my team was on a playoff run  
Oh baby, baby, baby, you mean everything to me  
But could you move your butt, you're blocking the TV?  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And a man he does tire  
Gets sleepy and naps on the couch  
Oh baby, oh honey, oh darling, oh pudding, what are you doing with that
suitcase? Leaving me? What do you mean we don't communicate? We're talking all
the time. We're talk about-- Ooh! Monster trucks! That little Volkswagon ain't
got no chance against The Cowcrusher! c'mon Cowcrusher, crush that little
Volks-- you're gone. I hope she left me one of them pudding pops. They're
tasty.  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And he shops at Canadian Tire  
And he always keeps his coupons  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And a man he expires  
And he cried when Wayne Gretzky retired  
  



Got my tweed pressed, got my best vest, all I need now is the girl  
Got my striped tie, got my hopes high  
Got the time and the place and I got the rhythm,  
Now all I need's the girl to go with 'em  
  
If she'll just appear we'll take this big town for a whirl  
And if she'll say "My, darling, I'm yours"  
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best-pressed tweed  
All I really need is the girl  
  
Got my tweed pressed, I got my best vest, all I need now is the girl  
Got my striped tie, got my hopes 'way up high  
I got the time and the place and the rhythm  
All I need's the girl to go with 'em  
  
Mm, if she'll just appear we'll take this, this great big town for a whirl  
And if, if she'll say "My, darlin', I'm yours"  
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best-pressed tweed  
All I real, really need is the girl



Let me take you down,  
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.  
Strawberry Fields forever.  
  
Living is easy with eyes closed,  
Misunderstanding all you see.  
It's getting hard to be someone  
But it all works out,  
It doesn't matter much to me.  
  
Let me take you down,  
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.  
Strawberry Fields forever.  
  
No one I think is in my tree,  
I mean it must be high or low.  
That is you can't you know tune in  
But it's all right, that is  
I think it's not too bad.  
  
Let me take you down,  
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.  
Strawberry Fields forever.  
  
Always, no sometimes, think it's me,  
But you know I know when it's a dream.  
I think I know I mean a 'Yes'  
But it's all wrong, that is I think I disagree.  
  
Let me take you down,  
'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.  
Nothing is real and nothing to get hungabout.  
Strawberry Fields forever.  
Strawberry Fields forever.



Kau datang lagi kau tak sendiri  
Aku mengerti bukan berarti kau kembali  
Tak perlu lagi kita sesali  
Semua janji walau kini tak terjadi  
  
Reff:  
Jangan pernah kau kira  
Hatiku tak akan duka  
Apa yang kau impikan  
Akupun mendambakan  
  
Ku tulis lagi kisah yang ini  
Kan kuulangi kuingat lagi sampai nanti  
  
Kembali ke Reff  
  
Kau datang lagi kau tak sendiri  
Aku mengerti bukan berarti kau kembali



You got me headed in a new direction  
Got no reason to turn around  
Ain't got no looking back or second guessing  
It's time to find what love is really all about  
  
Go the distance  
Let our hearts lead us on  
All the way to forever tonight  
Can't resist it  
The feelin's way too strong  
Go the distance this time  
  
The road to love is paved with shiftin' gravel  
We may find ourselves on shaky ground  
And there ain't no place  
That these two hearts can't travel  
Even when we're miles apart  
Together we are bound to  
  
Go the distance  
Let our hearts lead us on  
All the way to forever tonight  
Can't resist it  
The feelin's way too strong  
Go the distance this time  
  
There will be rainy days and bridges left to cross  
But if we lose our way we can't get lost if we  
  
Go the distance  
Let our hearts lead us on  
All the way to forever tonight  
Can't resist it  
The feelin's way too strong  
Go the distance this time



Just one look  
I felt so I, I, I'm in love  
with you  
I found out  
  
How good it feels  
To have your love  
Say you will  
Will be mine  
  
Forever and always  
Just one look and I knew  
That you were my only one  
  
I thought I was dreaming  
But I was wrong, yeah yeah yeah  
Oh, but I'm gonna keep on scheming  
'Til I can make you  
Make you my own  
  
Can't you see  
That I really care  
Without you  
I'm nothin'  
Just one look  
And I knew  
I'll get you some day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just one look, that's all it took  
Just one look



A catfish he tends to groove on the water  
It's just where he's bound to be  
And a monkey kinds of flashes on fruits and bananas  
So he lives in the top of a tree  
But my eyes are made for darkness  
And so the nighttime is right for me  
  
Said I'm a night owl, honey  
Sleep all day long  
  
Now most folks they like the good day time  
They like to see the shining sun  
They're up in the morning  
Off and running  
'Till they're too tired for having fun  
But when the sun goes down  
And them bright light shine  
My daytime has just begun  
  
I'm a night owl, honey  
Sleep all day long  
  
Said turn off that bright light, baby  
You're just about to drive me blind  
Draw them curtains for me, mama  
You watch and you'll see  
How my love light shines  
  
Now, there's two sides to this  
Great big world  
And one of them is always night  
Hey, if you can take care of  
Business in the sunshine, baby  
I guess you're gonna be alright  
But don't come looking for string bean  
To lend you a hand  
Because my eyes they can't stand the light  
  
No, I'm a night owl, honey  
Sleep all, sleep all day long  
I said sleep all day long  
I'm a night owl, honey

Sometimes I wonder if my beating heart has a reason  
The thought of breathing only takes my breath away  
I've spent so many nights wrestling with this feeling  
Do I have the strength to make it through the day  
But I was never meant  
To walk this road alone  
I can always trust you  
When you say  
  
I will carry you  
Be your strength  
And pull you through  
Reach for me  
And take my hand  
We will pray  
And we will stand  
In a world  
Crying out for peace  
Let your heart be strong  
For when I am weak  
You will carry me  
  
Sometimes you wonder if the road you're on has a reason  
It's hard to go on when you just don't know  
We can shoulder all the weight of life between us  
Until the fear of what we cannot see is gone  
Cause we were never meant  
To walk this road alone  
We are bound together  
When we say



Funky is the word,  
You're right,  
Or grow strong,  
Funky is the word.  
  
Oh, this is so funky,  
Funky in my heart,  
This girl is funky,  
The girl in my dreams cracks me up.  
  
Funky, oh that's the word,  
But Jane, do you really care how funky styles of your could be?  
Can you just see me lone-ly?  
Funky is the word you could only say.  
  
It's so funky,  
Jane, can't you see?  
You could be loved by any boy in the world,  
Funky, it's the word.  
  
The word is funky,  
The word is funky,  
Oh how a shame,  
It's too funky.



Jean, Jean, roses are red  
All the leaves have gone green  
And the clouds are so low  
You can touch them, and so  
Come out to the meadow, Jean  
  
Jean, Jean, you're young and alive  
Come out of your half-dreamed dream  
And run, if you will, to the top of the hill  
Open your arms, bonnie Jean  
  
Till the sheep in the valley come home my way  
Till the stars fall around me and find me alone  
When the sun comes a-singin' I'll still be waitin'  
  
For Jean, Jean, roses are red  
And all of the leaves have gone green  
While the hills are ablaze with the moon's yellow haze  
Come into my arms, bonnie Jean  
  
(Jean, Jean)  
Jean, you're young and alive!!  
Come out of your half-dreamed dream  
And run, if you will to the top of the hill  
Come into my arms, bonnie Jean  
  
Jean  
  
La-la-la-la, etc.



Love was born on christmas day  
  
It was a dark starry night  
That made the world see the light  
Three wise men followed the star  
The angels led them to a new born child  
When they saw him love filled the air  
  
It was a cold December night  
A father, a mother, and a child  
  
Chorus:  
Love was born on Christmas day  
Love was born on Christmas day  
Sleeping in a manger  
Was the world only Saviour  
Humble beginnings of love  
We're given and shown to the world  
Love was born on Christmas day  
  
Frankincense, Myrth and gold  
We're the first gifts of love  
Given to a poor child by kings  
A shepherd and his lambs  
Gathered around to see a miracle  
On a peaceful night angels sung and prayed  
  
Picture of love on a cold December night  
A father, a mother, and a child  
  
Repeat chorus 2X



It's a lovely day today  
So whatever you've got to do  
You've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true  
  
And I hope whatever you've got to do  
Is something that can be done by two  
For I'd really like to stay  
  
It's a lovely day today  
And whatever you've got to do  
I'd be so happy to be doing it with you  
  
But if you've got something that must be done  
And it can only be done by one  
There is nothing more to say  
Except it's a lovely day for saying  
It's a lovely day  
  
[2]  
It's a lovely day today  
And whatever I've got to do  
I've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true  
  
But perhaps whatever I've got to do  
Is something that can be done by two  
If it is then you could stay  
  
It's a lovely day today  
But you're probably busy too  
So I suppose there's nothing we can do  
  
For if you've got something that must be done  
And it can only be done by one  
There is nothing more to say  
Except it's a lovely day for saying  
It's a lovely day  
  
[3]  
It's a lovely day today  
If you've something that must get done  
Now don't forget two heads are better than just one  
  
And besides I'm certain if you knew me  
You'd find I'm very good company  
Won't you kindly let me stay?  
  
[4]  
It's a lovely day today  
And whatever we've got to do  
We've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true  
  
And I know whatever we've got to do  
Is something that can be done by two  
  
I'll say it's a lovely day for saying  
It's a lovely day



Silent Night  
Holy Night

Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace

Heavenly hosts sing alleluia  
Christ the Savior is born  
Christ the Savior is born  
  
Silent Night  
Holy Night  
Son of God  
Love's pure light  
Radiant beams from thy holy face  
With the down of redeeming grace  
Jesus, Lord at thy birth  
Jesus, Lord at thy birth



Papa, who's to blame  
Why you never had your fortune and fame  
Papa what did you gain  
To leave the love you had for a two-bit dame  
Papa why did you turn your back  
Why didn't you stay on track  
Why did you leave and make her cry  
Papa you meant to the world to me  
Why did you abandon me  
Now it's a long and sad goodbye  
  
Papa what is this game  
With all that cheating you did you're going to go insane  
Papa I am in pain  
Cause on the day you left you said I'd do the same  
Papa, why did you turn your back  
Why didn't you stay on track  
Why did you leave and make her cry  
Papa you meant that world to me  
Why did you abandon me  
Now it's a long and sad goodbye  
  
Papa  
No  
Oh papa  
Papa  
Oh papa  
No  
Oh papa  
  
Why did you turn your back  
Why didn't you stay on track  
Why did you leave and make her cry  
Papa you meant the world to me  
Why did you abandon me  
Now it's a long and sad goodbye  
  
Papa  
No  
Oh papa  
Oh papa  
Oh papa  
No no no stay



My baby don't love me  
My baby's gone and made me sad  
My baby don't love me  
My baby's gone and made me sad  
  
A hard hearted woman  
A hard hearted woman true  
My baby don't love me  
My baby don't love me  
  
Oh baby, let the flags fly at half mast  
Let this darkened hour drift past  
Oh baby, you don't know  
How much I'm missing you  
  
All my tears are falling  
Slow blues is calling  
Oh baby, you don't know  
How much I'm missing you  
  
Oh baby, baby, baby, go tell this crazy world the true tale  
Please let loose this lover's ship to sail  
Oh baby, you don't know  
How much I'm missing you  
  
You don't know how much I love you  
Oh no no no no no  
  
My baby don't love me  
My baby's gone and made me sad  
My baby don't love me  
My baby's gone and made me sad



There's not a world of difference  
Out in the world tonight  
Between this world of people  
Red, Yellow, Black and White  
But instead of riding a rainbow of love  
We still are fighting with prejudice gloves  
Of anger  
With something to claim  
But nothing to gain so  
  
[Chorus]  
Why can't we be color blind  
You know we should  
Be living together  
And we'd find a reason and rhyme  
I know we would  
Cause we could see better  
If we could be color blind  
  
Somebody's just assuming  
He's up to nothing good  
Cause he's not like the others  
There goes the neighborhood  
What kind of world are we living in  
When we judge a man by the tone of his skin  
It's crazy  
Cause he has a heart  
Like you have a heart and  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It'd be so fine  
To be color blind  
To open our eyes  
And see color blind  
  
I know this world would be a better place  
The only race would be the human race  
All of those barriers would be erased  
Why can't we be color blind  
  
[Chorus]



The Mississippi Delta was shining like a National guitar  
I am following the river down the highway through the cradle of the Civil War  
I'm going to Graceland Graceland in Memphis Tennessee I'm going to Graceland  
Poorboys and pilgrims with families and we are going to Graceland  
My traveling companion is nine years old the child of my first marriage  
But I've reason to believe we both will be received in Graceland  
  
She comes back to tell me she's gone  
As if I didn't know that as if I didn't know my own bed  
As if I'd never noticed she way she brushed her hair from her forehead  
And she said losing love is like a window in your heart  
Everybody sees you're blown apart everybody feels the wind blow  
I'm going to Graceland Graceland in Memphis Tennessee I'm going to Graceland  
Poorboys and pilgrims with families and we are going to Graceland  
My traveling companions are ghosts and empty sockets ghosts and empties  
But I've reason to believe we both will be received in Graceland  
  
There is a girl in Austin Texas and she calls herself the human trampoline  
Sometimes when I'm falling flying tumbling in turmoil I say this is what she
means  
She means we're bouncing into Graceland  
And I see losing love ss like a window in your heart  
Everybody sees you're blown apart everybody feels the wind blow  
And I'm going to Graceland in Memphis Tennessee I'm going to Graceland  
For reasons I cannot explain some part of me wants to see Graceland  
And I may be obliged to defend every love every ending  
Or maybe there's no obligations now  
Maybe I've a reason to believe we all will be received in Graceland  
Oh oh Graceland I'm going to Graceland



Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game  
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game  
She's walking down the street  
Blind to every eye she meets  
Do you think you'll be the guy  
To make the queen of the angels sigh?  
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game  
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?  
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game  
She holds her head so high, like a statue in the sky  
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long  
When she moves my brain screams out this song  
Sidewalk crouches at her feet  
Like a dog that begs for something sweet  
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?  
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?  
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello  
I want you, hello, I need my baby  
Hello, hello, hello, hello



If I should stay, I'll only be in your way  
So I'll go, but I know I'll  
Think of you every step of the way  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
You, my darling you, hmmm,  
  
Bittersweet memories  
That is all I'm taking with me  
So, goodbye  
Please, don't cry  
We both know I'm not what you, you need  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
  
I hope life treats you kind  
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of  
And I wish to you, joy and happiness  
But above all this, I wish you love  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I, I will always love you  
  
You, darling, I love you  
Oh, I'll always, I'll always love you



Billy on his way to school  
Didn't care too much about the teachers and rules  
But he had a plan he said he'd try it one day  
One he knew would leave them all with nothing to say  
He had a friend who said he'd teach him how to rock and roll  
After school when he was feelin' good  
He'd go home and do the things that he understood  
He would rock in the kitchen and roll in the hall  
And Billy's mother said you got no sense at all  
But we know too well that he was  
Learning how to rock and roll  
  
Cause he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall  
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall  
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor  
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more  
And that's the only way to do it  
When you're learning how to rock and roll  
Teach me to rock...  
  
Willy turns to the mirror and gives his hair a flip  
He would mime to Elvis and curl his lip  
Ha ha in the kitchen  
Ha ha in the hall  
Willy's mother said you got no sense at all  
But we know too well that he was  
Learning how to rock and roll  
  
Cause he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall  
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall  
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor  
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more  
And that's the only way to do it  
When you're learning how to rock and roll  
Teach me to rock...  
  
He learnt to rock and roll  
And sing the blues  
He learnt to head shake  
While singing blue suede shoes  
He learnt a hand clap  
Off the beat  
And at the gig he had them out of their seats  
It's the only way to do it so long live rock and roll  
  
Cause he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall  
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall  
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor  
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more  
And that's the only way to do it  
When you're learning how to rock and roll  
Teach me to rock...



It's a hard way to come home  
You've got me on my knees  
The walls are tumbling down  
They're falling like the leaves  
  
The days turned into months and years  
I can't forget that you were here  
I feel your presence everywhere  
In the corner over there  
  
Turn your eyes from me  
It's time for me to go  
Across the hills and over the sea  
I want you more than you know  
  
It's a wild world out there  
And nobody gives a damn  
In cold blood we don't care  
And we don't want to understand  
  
I'm sitting here alone at night  
My sleepless eyes are open wide  
What do you want me to say  
What we had has gone away  
  
The sky is high the road is long  
Show me what I should have done  
What do you want me to do  
Take it all away from you  
  
Turn your eyes from me  
It's time for me to go  
Across the hills and over the sea  
I want you more than you know  
  
Turn your eyes from me  
It's time for me to go  
Across the hills and over the sea  
I want you more than you know



Something for the girl with everything  
See, the writings on the wall  
You bought the girl a wall  
Complete with matching ball-point pen  
  
You can breathe another day  
Secure in knowing she won't break you (yet)  
Something for the girl with everything  
Have another sweet my dear  
  
Don't try to talk my dear  
Your tiny little mouth is full  
Here's a flavour you ain't tried  
You shouldn't try to talk, your mouth is full  
  
Something for the girl with everything  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
Bearing gifts to aid amnesia  
  
She knows everything  
Yes yes everyting  
She knew way back when you weren't yourself  
Something for the girl with everything  
  
Here's a really preatty car  
I hope it takes you far  
I hope it takes you fast and far  
Wow, the engines really loud  
  
Nobodys gonna hear a thing you say  
Something for the girl with everything  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
  
Where should they leave these imported gimmicks  
Leave them anywhere  
An-an-anywhere  
Make sure that there's a clear path to the door  
  
Something for the girl with everything  
Something for the girl with everything  
Something for the girl with everything  
Something for the girl with everything  
  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
  
Here's a patridge in a tree,  
A gardener for the tree  
Complete with ornithologist  
Careful, careful with that crate  
  
You wouldn't want to dent Sinatra, no  
Something for the girl who has got everything,  
Yes, yes, everything  
Hey, come out and say hello  
  
Before you friends all go  
But say no more than just hello  
Ah, the little girl is shy  
You see of late she's been quite speechless,  
  
Very speechless  
She's got everything



Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you!



[Chorus: ]  
The chances you gave me  
A definite maybe  
But luck she's a lady, stayed  
She played for me  
  
There's gold in the mountain  
Good fortune for countin'  
Three coins in the fountain  
And my luck won't change  
  
Take dust from the coalmine  
Make dust from the goldmine  
King Midas you're sidelined  
And my luck won't change no my luck remains  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
No point in shouting,  
Whoever there was doubting,  
I'm at the top of the mountain  
And my luck won't change  
  
The stock market read it  
The rumors they spread it  
And I meant it when I said it  
That my luck won't change  
No, my luck remains  
  
That old lover lost me  
She spent and she cost me  
My new love has taught me  
That my luck won't change  
(my luck won't change, my luck remains)  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
The offer she made me  
Was more than just maybe  
But luck who's a lady stayed  
She played for me  
  
[Repeat: 1st verse]  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
My temperature's rising  
No point in disguising  
The phoenix is arising  
And my luck won't change, no it just remains



I have often walked down this street before  
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before  
All at once am I several stories high  
Knowing I'm on the street where you live  
  
Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?  
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?  
Does enchantment pour out of every door?  
No, it's just on the street where you live  
  
And oh, the towering feeling just to know somehow you are near  
The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear  
  
People stop and stare, they don't bother me  
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be  
Let the time go by, I won't care if I  
Can be here on the street where you live



Don't it sometimes feel  
As if the world is turned upside down.  
We're all standing on our heads.  
Tryin' to make the most of this,  
Kinda makes it feel like your heavy.  
  
Don't it sometimes feel like you got too much to bear.  
Well let it at the door my friend,  
Come inside and let's have a good good  
Good good time tonight  
Try forget it all  
'Cause it will still be there tomorrow,  
You can be sure, it will still be there for us all.  
  
Let's have a good good time tonight  
That's what I preach, yeah.  
You can leave the problems out  
We come back to teach about  
The fun I like good good time  
Nobody be there by my side  
Close your eyes, shake it up, shake it up.  
Baby ya look good tonight  
It's a good good time tonight, yeah  
  
Stumble self down, fall down,  
Scrape your knee, rub it good.  
You wake up with your head feels like,  
Someone's beatin' on you.  
End of story  
But overboard, overboard  
Just for this evening  
Leave it behind, leave it behind,  
Let's dance the night away.  
  
Let's have a good good time tonight  
Hope ya can if ya will.  
Try to leave your tears after all  
Bring 'em in to show everyone  
We can get to the bottom of this bottle  
We could end of this burning toll  
Roll up now, roll it up another one,  
And another fall through before.  
Let's have a good good time tonight  
  
It's a good good time tonight  
It's a good good time tonight  
It's a good good time tonight  
It's a good good time tonight



Well, I'm looking at you  
And I'm wondering what you're gonna do  
Looks like you got no friends  
No one to stick with you till the end  
  
Take yourself a friend  
Keep 'em till the end  
Whether woman or man  
It makes you feel so good  
So good  
  
Yes, you think you're all right,  
And now you're lonely every night  
Well, you need a friend  
Someone on whom you can always depend  
  
Take yourself a friend  
Keep 'em till the end  
Whether woman or man  
It makes you feel so good  
So good  
  
Yes, you need some advice  
Well, let me put it to you nice  
I said you need a friend  
Someone who'll stick with you to the end  
  
Take yourself a friend  
Keep 'em till the end  
Whether woman or man  
It makes you feel so good  
So good



Any time now I'm gonna wake up and see the day.  
Any time now I'm gonna wake up and find my way.  
And by that time now, you're gonna never ever never ever hear  
Me say, "That was the longest damn day."  
  
Do you ever truly feel that it's a waste of time  
To live a day?  
I mean, deep inside have you convinced yourself there's much  
More to get out of the way?  
But, for me it's that last baby moment before I wake.  
It bless my soul, caress my heart, leave me  
Wishing for a brighter day.  
  
Any time now I'm gonna wake up and see the day.  
Any time now I'm gonna wake up and find my way.  
And by that time now, you're gonna never ever never ever hear me  
Say, "That was the longest damn day."  
  
Do you ever truly dream and stay inside them  
Before you wake?  
I mean, deep inside can you relax the mind  
And grab the minute like the last one to save?  
Well, for me it's that last baby moment before I rise,  
It fills me with wonder, it bless my soul, catch the dream before I open my
eyes.  
  
Any time now I'm gonna wake up and see the day.  
Any time now I'm gonna wake up and find my way.  
And by that time now, you're gonna never ever never ever heard me say,  
"That was the longest damn day."  
  
One, two, three more days will never be enough for me.  
One, two, three more lifetimes will bless my soul for my eyes can see  
That I can wake up if I want to.  
But I'll just stay inside my mind.  
One, two, three more days will never be enough for me.  
One, two, three more lifetimes will bless my mind for my soul is free.  
  
Any time now I'm gonna wake up and see the day.  
Any time now I'm gonna wake up and find my way.



As I sit around, watchin' the rain come down  
It puts me in the mood  
It reminds me of, the first time I met you, girl  
And I hear the rain on the windowpane  
And it brings back memories  
Of the love we made  
And the things that we used to do  
Yes, and I recall the thrill of it all  
When the heat had just begun  
Everything was fine, nothing never did go wrong  
  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
From the very start  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
Then you broke my heart  
I didn't know what to do  
After lovin' you  
And I couldn't get a real good start  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
And I' m still missing you a lot  
So when I hear rain, it just brings back pain  
You gave the best love I ever had  
It's a doggone shame, 'cause it sure felt good to me  
Sometimes I wonder, where did you disappear to  
How did you get away, baby  
And I often think of you  
Do you ever think of me, baby  
Sometimes love don't work, the way you think it should  
When your love jones comes on down, baby  
But baby I still care and I think that I always will  
  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
From the very start  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
Then you broke my heart  
I didn't know how to act  
After your bags were packed  
And I couldn't get a real good start  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
And I'm still lovin' you a lot, oh well



There was a time I walked the earth  
As if I knew my way  
It seems the more I got around  
The less I had to say  
  
I built a world of tumbling dice  
Upon a field of sand  
And now the more I try to give  
The more that you demand  
So we wait, then discard, house of cards  
  
I took a pane of broken glass  
And made a diamond ring  
For every single blade of grass  
Mm, of thee I sing  
Why we wait, hesitate, I don't know  
  
Don't tell me 'bout your world coming apart  
Should have known about you girl, right from the start  
So we wait, to discard, house of cards  
  
I'm walking down a lonely road  
To the edge of town  
If you try and change my mind  
I won't turn around  
Tell me why I should try once again  
House of cards



My baby don't care for shows  
My baby don't care for clothes  
My baby just cares for me  
My baby don't care for cars and races  
My baby don't care for high-tone places  
  
Liz Taylor is not his style  
And even Lana Turner's smile  
Is somethin' he can't see  
My baby don't care who knows  
My baby just cares for me  
  
Baby, my baby don't care for shows  
And he don't even care for clothes  
He cares for me  
My baby don't care  
For cars and races  
Baby don't care for  
He don't care for high-tone places  
  
Liz Taylor is not his style  
And even Liberace's smile  
Is something he can't see  
Is something he can't see  
I wonder what's wrong with baby  
My baby just cares for  
My baby just cares for  
My baby just cares for me



Lose it?  
Lose it?  
I don't even know the first thing  
About what they're feeling  
What am I afraid of?  
Don't know what I'm made of  
Can I go on  
Not knowing?  
  
Feeling?  
Feeling?  
Something tells me  
That it's more than I can deal with  
Though I never knew the song  
Some words still catch on  
Like caring and sharing  
Being together no matter  
  
Can I go on  
Not knowing?  
Don't know what I'm made of  
Why am I afraid of feeling?  
Feeling?  
If I dare to take a chance  
Would someone lead me?



I took their smiles and I made them mine.  
I, I sold my soul just to hide the light.  
And now I see what I really am,  
A thief a whore, and a liar.  
I run to you,  
Call out your name,  
I see you there, father away.  
  
I'm numb to you numb and deaf and blind.  
You give me all but the reason why.  
I reach but I feel only air at night.  
Not you, not love, just nothing.  
I run to you,  
Call out your name,  
I see you there, father away.  
  
Try to forget you,  
But without you I feel nothing.  
Don't leave me here, by myself.  
I can't breathe.  
I run to you,  
Call out your name,  
I see you there, father away.  
  
I run to you,  
Call out your name,  
I see you there, father away,  
Farther away,  
Father away,  
Father away,  
Father away,  
Father away.



From this moment on,  
You for me dear,  
Only two for tea dear,  
From this moment on,  
  
From this happy day,  
No more blue songs,  
Only hoop-de-doo songs,  
From this moment on  
  
You've got the love I need so much  
Got the skin I love to touch  
Got the arms to hold me tight  
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight  
  
From this moment on  
You and I babe  
We'll be ridin' high babe  
Every care is gone  
From this moment on.  
  
You've got the love I need so much  
Got the skin I love to touch  
Got the arms to hold me tight  
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight  
  
From this moment on  
You and I babe  
We'll be ridin' high babe  
Every care is gone  
From this moment,  
From this moment,  
This very moment,  
This moment on.



Cat's eye, apple pie, what am I going to do,  
The woman I loved walked out on me,  
What am I going to do.  
Hound dog, bull frog, she just up and gone,  
The woman I love has done me wrong,  
What am I going to do.  
Green beans, black eyed peas,  
What am I going to do,  
The woman I love has let me down,  
What am I going to do.  
  
She's a delta queen know what I mean,  
As mean as wildfire lightnin',  
She can win and break the heart of any man,  
She's the delta queen of New Orleans,  
And she loved me somethin' frightnin',  
But she left me for a dollar wavin' man.



Sundown, summer is fading.  
Run now, here the winter comes.  
Deep down, in some snowdrift.  
Frozen fire, thought you found the lift.  
  
It's a showdown, it's a Mexican standoff.  
And the river, is the prize.  
To float away on her current,  
To the sea lover, to the sea.  
  
And I know there's a song in the wind to the sky.  
And I know there's a song somewhere for you and I.  
What I don't know is if we'll hear it.  
I'm losin' spirit, woman sing to me.



Is this the real life?  
Is this just fantasy?  
Caught in a landslide  
No escape from reality  
Open your eyes  
Look up to the skies and see  
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy  
Because I'm easy come, easy go  
A little high, little low  
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me  
  
Mama, just killed a man  
Put a gun against his head  
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead  
Mama, life had just begun  
But now I've gone and thrown it all away  
Mama, ooo  
Didn't mean to make you cry  
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow  
Carry on, carry on, but nothing really matters  
  
Too late, my time has come  
Sends shivers down my spine  
Body's aching all the time  
Goodbye everybody I've got to go  
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth  
Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)  
I don't want to die  
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all  
  
I see a little silhouetto of a man  
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango  
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me  
Gallileo, Gallileo,  
Gallileo, Gallileo,  
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico  
  
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me  
He's just a poor boy from a poor family  
Spare him his life from this monstrosity  
Easy come easy go will you let me go  
Bismillah! No we will not let you go - let him go  
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go  
Bismillah! We will not let you go let me go  
Will not let you go let me go (never)  
Never let you go let me go  
Never let me go ooo  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go  
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me  
For me  
For me  
  
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye  
So you think you can love me and leave me to die  
Oh baby can't do this to me baby  
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here  
  
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah  
Nothing really matters  
Anyone can see  
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me  
  
Anyway the wind blows



Mommy, where's daddy?  
Mommy, where's daddy?  
  
Right here, girl  
Sweet thing, you look so sad  
Cheer up, don't you know your dad is bad  
Give daddy a kiss, girl  
Oh, dad  
  
There ain't no problem I can't face, 'cos  
Your daddy's got a bigger bag of tricks  
Give daddy a kiss, girl  
Oh, dad  
  
Mommy, where's daddy?  
Mommy, where's daddy?  
  
Come on, sit on your daddy's lap 'cos  
I'm the one who pats your back  
Give daddy a kiss, girl  
Oh, dad  
  
Lemme see now where to begin  
Lemme start by tuckin' you in  
Give daddy a kiss, girl  
Oh, dad  
  
Mommy, where's daddy?



(ian hunter)  
  
I was your baby-you were my girl  
When I asked you to marry me- the tears fell  
  
Sons n' lovers, sons n' lovers, waving  
My childhood goodbye-it seems so sad  
Well how long have you been my best friend  
This won't be the end of  
Sons n' lovers-sons n' lovers--she won't wanna talk anymore about it  
  
You were my lady- I was your number one  
When I said I was leaving- tears run  
  
Sons n' lovers-sons n' lovers, breakin'  
Tryin' not to hurt each others hearts  
Well how long can we exist- I know  
We can't go on like this  
Sons n' lovers-son's and lovers--i don't wanna lie anymore  
  
Was that you I saw--walkin' out along the shore  
Was that you I saw-talkin' to him  
Was that you I saw-puttin' his hands in yours  
That's alright ma- you can still love him  
That's alright ma- you can still love  
And through the years-you know- we will remember  
Time will never take old times away  
How long for you to discover that- there still some strings attached to  
Sons n' lovers-sons and lovers  
But I don't wanna play anymore  
Sons n' lovers



Some days are dry, some days are leaky  
Some days come clean, other days are sneaky  
Some days take less, but most days take more  
Some slip through your fingers and onto the floor  
  
Some days you're quick, but most days you're speedy  
Some days you use more force than is necessary  
Some days just drop in on us  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days it all adds up  
And what you got is not enough  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days are slippy, other days sloppy  
Some days you can't stand the sight of a puppy  
Your skin is white but you think you're a brother  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days you wake up with her complaining  
Some sunny days you wish it was raining  
Some days are sulky, some days have a grin  
And some days have bouncers and won't let you in  
  
Some days you hear a voice  
Taking you to another place  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days are honest, some days are not  
Some days you're thankful for what you've got  
Some days you wake up in the army  
And some days it's the enemy  
  
Some days are work, most days you're lazy  
Some days you feel like a bit of a baby  
Lookin' for Jesus and His mother  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days you feel ahead  
You're making sense of what she said  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days you hear a voice  
Taking you to another place  
Some days are better than others



She throws back her hair [hands] and she shows you her mouth  
The breath that I waste trying to ruin your life  
Beauty's on a budget but you take it on the chin  
'Cause you have to do your duty taking orders from the kingpin  
  
[Chorus:]  
You've got a chemistry class I want a piece of your mind  
You don't know what you started when you mixed it up with mine  
Are you ready for the final solution? Oh. Oh.  
  
[They] chopped you up in butcher's school  
Threw you out of the academy of garbage  
You'll be a joker all your life  
A student at the comedy college  
People pleasing people pleasing people like you  
You've been around so long but you still don't know what to do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Sparks are flying from electrical pylons  
Snakes and ladders running up and down her nylons  
Ready to experiment, you're ready to be burned  
If it wasn't for some accidents then some would never ever learn  
  
[Chorus:]



Lashing out the action, returning the reaction  
Weak are ripped and torn away  
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower  
Battery is here to stay  
  
Smashing through the boundaries  
Lunacy has found me  
Cannot stop the battery  
Pounding out aggression  
Turns into obsession  
Cannot kill the battery  
  
Cannot kill the family  
Battery is found in me  
  
Battery  
  
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers  
Never ending potency  
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker  
Breeding on insanity  
  
Smashing through the boundaries  
Lunacy has found me  
Cannot stop the battery  
Pounding out aggression  
Turns into obsession  
Cannot kill the battery  
  
Cannot kill the family  
Battery is found in me  
  
Battery  
  
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing  
Powerhouse of energy  
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry  
We create the battery  
  
Smashing through the boundaries  
Lunacy has found me  
Cannot stop the battery  
Pounding out aggression  
Turns into obsession  
Cannot kill the battery  
  
Cannot kill the family  
Battery is found in me  
  
Battery



Alone upon the sidewalks of despair, 'twas there she wandered with her
suitcase in her hand.  
Her fate she pondered, only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care.  
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there and the band was
grooving.  
When he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her,  
How was she to know at the time he would mistreat her?  
  
In her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way,  
And before the set was through he knew she would be his loved one.  
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care,  
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere.  
  
He's playing up in Michigan with a group they call The Intended,  
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone, the song was ended.  
But as she walks, she waits for him, the pavement is a shoulder for her tears,  
But in her heart, she knows there is no way she can hope to change him.  
  
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care,  
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere,  
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care, a go-go girl in love.



That's how much I love you  
That's how much I need you  
And I can't stand you  
Must everything you do make me wanna smile  
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)  
  
But you won't let me  
You upset me, girl  
And then you kiss my lips  
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)  
Can't remember what you did  
  
(But I hate it) You know exactly what to do  
So that I can't stay mad at you  
For too long, that's wrong  
  
(But I hate it) You know exactly how to touch  
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more  
Said I despise that I adore you  
  
And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)  
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)  
And I hate how much I love you, boy (ooh, whoa)  
But I just can't let you go  
And I hate that I love you so (ooh)  
  
And you completely know the power that you have (the power that you have)  
The only one makes me laugh (one that makes you laugh)  
  
Sad, and it's not fair  
How you take advantage of the fact  
That I love you beyond a reason why  
And it just ain't right  
  
And I hate how much I love you, girl  
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)  
And I hate how much I love you, girl  
But I just can't let you go  
But I hate that I love you so  
  
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me  
And your kiss won't make me weak  
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me  
So you'll probably always have a spell on me  
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
That's how much I love you (how much I need you)  
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)  
That's how much I love you (Oh, need you)  
That's how much I need you (I need you)  
  
And I hate that I love you so  
And I hate how much I love you, boy  
I can't stand how much I need ya (I can't stand how much I need you)  
And I hate how much I love you, boy  
But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go, no)  
And I hate that I love you so (ooh)  
  
And I hate that I love you so, so



Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking  
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah  
When she walks, she's like a samba that swings so cool and sways so gentle  
When she passes, each one she passes goes - ooh  
  
Ooh, but I watch her so sadly, how can I tell her I love her  
Yes I would give my heart gladly,  
But each day, when she walks to the sea  
She looks straight ahead, not at me  
  
Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking



Old lion's dying, got left behind  
Cut your teeth, lose your meat  
And man it's just a matter of time  
Key's to the cuffs, you might be king  
That's it, that's all, that's everything  
  
Skeletons come here to dance  
Where barrooms beat their brothers  
Into a bloody trance  
What's the deal? what did I do?  
Who cops all the cops is all I asked of you  
  
Lining up, waiting on the trickle down  
Something's up, taking time to get around  
Belly up, all the drinks are on the crown  
It's just a matter of trickle down  
  
Twenty miles before the crash  
That's the style for a while  
And man I think it's gonna last  
"hit the brakes" is all you can say  
Conductor says we'll save them  
For another rainy day



If coke  
Is a mystery  
Michael Jackson  
History  
If beauty is truth  
And surgery the fountain of youth  
What am I to do  
Have I got the gifts to get me through  
The gates of that mansion  
If OJ is more than a drink  
And a Big Mac bigger than you think  
If perfume is an obsession  
And talk shows confession  
What have we got to lose  
Another push and maybe we'll be through  
The gates of that mansion  
  
I never bought a lotto ticket  
I never parked in anyone's space  
The banks they're like cathedrals  
I guess casinos took their place  
Love come on down  
Don't wake her she'll come around  
  
Chance is a kind of religion  
Where you're damned for plain hard luck  
I never did see that movie  
I never did read that book  
Love come on down  
Let my numbers come around  
  
Don't know if I can hold on  
Don't know if I'm that strong  
Don't know if I can wait that long  
Till the colors come flashing  
And the lights go on  
  
Then will there be no time of sorrow  
Then will there be no time for shame  
And though I can't say why  
I know I've got to believe  
  
We'll go driving in that pool  
It's who you know that gets you through  
The gates of the Playboy mansion  
Playboy mansion  
The Playboy mansion  
  
Then will there be no time of sorrow  
Then will there be no time for pain  
Then will there be no time of sorrow  
Then will there be no time for shame



One more game,  
It's time to play,  
Play with me  
  
(One more game)  
  
Just one more game,  
It's time to play,  
Come play my way  
  
I'm no more Mrs. Nice Girl,  
No playing home ground,  
I'm not the same girl,  
You never rocked my world,  
You used me,  
Tried to abuse me,  
The fame the life the fantasy,  
Now back to reality.  
  
(Your dramatic)  
  
The truth that lies can't hide,  
I'm not by your side  
I'll let you drownd in your drama  
Run to your mama,  
See if she can save you,  
When I'm not around you  
  
(So dramatic)  
  
No, no, no, no, you're not the one I thought you were,  
Now there's another ringing my bell,  
I'm under his spell,  
You're too dramatic,  
Understand it's over  
  
Baby, fuck you,  
The things you did, and never thought I'd get a clue,  
Yeah, you wanted me to be that faithful to you,  
Not let nobody's body touch my body in positions that we only knew  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)  
  
Now I'm gonna give him what he wants and more,  
Do all those explicit things that I told you "No",  
Places you couldn't go,  
You know where I'm talking,  
You are too dramatic  
  
No, no, no, no, you're not the one I thought you were.  
Now there's another ringing my bell,  
I'm under his spell,  
You're too dramatic,  
Understand it's over  
  
Aww, awww, awww, awww  
Aww, awww, awww, awww  
  
Come and play,  
You wanna play,  
Come play with me  
  
You're not the one I thought you were,  
Now there's another ringing my bell,  
I'm under his spell,  
You're too dramatic,  
Understand it's over  
  
You're not the one I thought you were,  
Now there's another ringing my bell,  
I'm under his spell,  
You're too dramatic,  
Understand it's over.  
Understand it's over.  
  
(You're so dramatic)



Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
Blinded by science, where do I belong?  
What's in the future, has it just begun  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
  
I worry 'bout the world that we live in  
I'm worried by all the confusion  
I wonder 'bout the lies I've been reading  
I wonder where this madness is leading  
  
Is this a road going nowhere?  
Or is someone leading us somewhere?  
I can't believe we're here for no reason  
There must be something we can believe in  
  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
I'm not an appliance, so don't turn me on  
What's in the future, has it just begun  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
  
What's in the future, has it just begun  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
  
I worry 'bout the world that we live in  
I'm worried by all the confusion  
I wonder 'bout the lies I've been reading  
I wonder where this madness is leading  
  
Is this a road going nowhere?  
Is someone leading us somewhere?  
I can't believe we're here for no reason  
There must be something we can believe in

I'm not an appliance, don't turn me on  
What's in the future, has it just begun  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
  
Blinded by science, I'm on the run  
I'm blinded by science, on the run



I hear music  
Mighty fine music  
The murmur of the morning breeze up there  
The rattle of the milkman on the stair  
  
Sure that's music  
Mighty fine music  
The singing of the sparrow in the sky  
The perking of the coffee right nearby  
  
That's my baby's melody  
When you my angel holding me  
  
I hear music  
Mighty fine music  
And anytime I think my world is wrong  
I get me out of bed and sing this song  
  
That's my favorite melody  
When you ma angel holding me  
  
I hear music  
Mighty fine music  
And anytime I think my world is wrong  
I get me out of bed and sing this song



She drew out all her money from the Southern Trust  
And put her little boy aboard a greyhound bus  
Leavin' Louisianne for the golden west  
Down came her tears from her happiness  
Her own little some named Johnney B Goode  
Was going to make some motion pictures down in Hollywood  
  
And sing bye bye, bye bye  
Bye bye, bye bye  
Bye bye Johnney, goodebye Johnny B Goode  
  
She remembered taking money in from gathering crops  
And buying Johnny?s guitar from the brokers shop  
As long as he was playing by the railroad side  
Wouldn't get in trouble, she?d be satisfied  
She never thought that there would come a day like this  
When she would have to give her son a goodbye kiss  
  
And sing bye bye, bye bye  
Bye bye, bye bye  
Bye bye Johnney, goodebye Johnny B Goode  
  
She finally got the letter she was dreaming of  
Cos Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love  
As soon as he was married he would bring her back  
And build a mansion for her by the railroad side  
So every time she heard the locomotive roar  
She be standing,waiting at the kitchen door  
  
And sing bye bye, bye bye  
Bye bye, bye bye  
Bye bye Johnney, goodebye Johnny B Goode



Let us pause in life's pleasures and count it's many tears  
While we all sup sorrow with the poor  
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
It's the song, a sign of the weary  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more  
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times, come again no more.  
  
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay  
There are frail forms fainting at the door  
Though their voices now are silent, their pleading look still say  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
It's a song, a sign of the weary  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more  
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times, come again no more.  
  
There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away  
With a warm heart, whose better days are o'er  
Though her voice should be merry, It's sighing all the day  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
It's a song, a sign of the weary  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more  
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times, come again no more.  
  
It's a side that has wafted across the trouble way  
It's a whale that is heard upon the shore  
It's a dirt that is merriment around the lonely grain  
Oh hard times, come again no more  
  
It's a song, a sign of the weary  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more  
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times, come again no more  
Oh hard times, come again no more!



It's a very happy day  
We are at lots of fun fun fun  
And it's ice-cream and jelly  
And a punch in the belly  
How much can you throw over the walls?  
  
And see how his face glows  
It's a bike! What a surprise.  
It's a big bike. What a big surprise.  
It's a red bike. What a red surprise.  
Oh, what a surprise.  
  
But the best thing there  
But the best thing there  
Was the wonderful dog chair  
Was the beautiful dog chair  
That could count right up to ten  
It could count right up to ten  
It went woof, woof, woof, woof, woof,  
Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.  
  
And it's another happy day.  
He was born eleven years ago  
And this year it's long trousers  
And a very smart tie.  
Just think in five years he'll be shaving.  
  
And see how his face glows  
It's a bike. What a surprise!  
It's a samurai sword.  
What a metal surprise.  
He'll remember this day for the rest of his life.  
  
But the best thing there  
But the best thing there  
Is that fabulous dog chair  
The immaculate dog chair  
That could count right up to eleven  
  
It could count right up to eleven  
It went woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof,  
Woof, woof, woof.  
  
But the best thing there  
But the best thing there  
Was my darling the dog chair  
But the rampaging dog chair  
That could count right up to eleven  
It could count right up to eleven.  
  
And it went round and round the house.



Here we lay face to face once again  
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend  
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know  
We're just holding on to "could have been"s and we should be letting go  
  
[Chorus]  
It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight  
I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right  
And we both know that the story's ending  
We play the part but we're just pretending and I can't hide the tears  
Cause even though you're here  
It feels like you're a million miles away  
  
Was it me, or was it you that broke away?  
For what we were is like a season love is change  
And every time I think about it, it tears me up inside  
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before  
While our song is playing its last note  
We both know for sure that it's time to close that door  
  
[Chorus]



Never look back but now never lose sight  
Of your past, oh no  
Change every moment knowing your decisions  
They just won't last, oh no  
  
Well it's different this time around  
I won't look back 'cause i found  
That gone are the days  
Long are the nights  
It feels right turning this time around  
  
Always the danger of falling into  
A mindless shell, oh yeah  
Come out of your shell don't fall into a trap  
You can't get out (can't get out, can't get out)  
  
Well it's different this time around  
I won't look back 'cause i found  
That gone are the days  
Long cold nights  
It feels like turning this time around  
  
When it hurts that bad  
You know my temperature rises  
It never goes down  
It's goin' up  
Straight up  
  
When it hurts that bad  
You know my temperature rises  
It never goes down  
It's goin' up  
Straight up, straight up  
  
Gone are the days  
Long are the nights  
It feels right turning this time around, oh yeah  
  
It's different this time around  
I won't look back 'cause i found  
That gone are the days  
Long are nights  
It feels right turning this time around



I would climb any mountain, sail across the stormy sea  
If that's what it takes me baby, to show how much you mean to me  
And I guess that it's just the woman in you, that brings out the man in me  
I know I can't help myself, you're all in the world to me  
  
[Chorus]  
It feels like the first time, feels like the very first time  
It feels like the first time, it feels like the very first time  
  
I have waited a lifetime, spent my time so foolishly  
But now that I found you, together we'll make history  
And I know that it must be the woman in you, that brings out the man in me  
I know I can't help myself, you're all my eyes can see  
  
And it feels like the first time, like it never did before  
Feels like the first time, like we've opened up the door  
Feels like the first time, like it never will again, never again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Open up the door, won't you open up the door  
  
[Chorus]

An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son  
His hands were meant for different work  
And his heart was known to none  
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way  
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay  
  
A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate  
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait  
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand  
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand  
  
The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old  
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul  
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man  
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band  
  
My brother's lives were different for they heard another call  
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul  
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel  
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well  
  
I thank you for the music and your stories of the road  
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go  
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough  
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough  
  
The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old  
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul  
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man  
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band  
I am a living legacy to the leader of the band  



I want to be a better man  
Lord knows that I'm trying  
I want to keep the master's plan  
But sometimes things get wild  
Demons sleep with me in bed  
I can feel their fire  
When darkness gets around my head  
Sometimes I go blind  
  
But you were in my heart  
While the evil eye was searching out was staring at me  
But you were in my heart  
While the maids of doom, were reaching out and tempting me  
  
The world can give you everything  
Anything you want  
Money, fame  
And all it brings  
Whatever turns you on  
But your bloods running through my veins  
And I am standing tall  
But even though you took my place  
You are somehow bound to fall  
  
But you were in my heart  
While the evil eye was searching out was staring at me  
But you were in my heart  
While the maids of doom, were reaching out and tempting me



When I joined a band I thought my life was pretty cool  
We'd stay in hotels with room service and pools  
Sign body parts for fans  
Check into rehab and smash up the van  
But looking back I should have stayed in school.  
  
Life out on the road can be dangerous you see  
To rock stock food and smelly roadies  
Are not nearly as scary  
As that girl who's at every show  
Mouthing the words from the front row  
The stalker girl is scaring the hell out of me  
  
She's my creepy stalker girl  
I'm the centre of her whacked out crazy and delusional world  
She follows me every everywhere  
She's even got a bag with some bits of my hair  
Just go away you creepy stalker girl  
  
She says I touch her in a very special way  
But I'd never go near her now without my pepper spray  
And the voices in her head  
Said break into my house and sleep in my bed  
And they also said that shaving the cat was okay  
  
She's my creepy stalker girl  
I'm the centre of her whacked out crazy and delusional world  
She follows me every everywhere  
She's even got a bag with some bits of my hair  
Just go away you creepy stalker girl  
  
I've analyzed your handwriting and I've got some bad news  
You're manic obsessive with the band and mad issues  
And you think that all our songs  
Are about you and you're usually wrong  
Except for now this song is so about you  
You creepy stalker girl, you creepy stalker girl, you creepy stalker girl



Yeah, yeah  
Check me out man, yeah  
  
Original gangsta, black clothes and bangers  
Bullet shells and chambers, fill the L's up  
We stay low from the rangers  
Cause they tryin' to tame us, but we brainless  
And just think, I'm one sell out record away from being famous  
Shit I guess I ain't it  
You could paint it how you may,  
But I remain this gangsta 'til the day I lay  
Where the worms stay  
I spit it for my nigga's sake  
I spit it for myself a long time ago  
Got a few houses, few whips, few condos  
I'm so straight I'm pointin'  
The game is hurtin', and baby boy the ointment  
Baby boy the president now  
Shit you gotta make an appointment  
Two record labels  
You should come join 'em  
Do check the label  
And make sure it's yellow or Roze  
'fore you bring it to my table  
  
[Chorus]  
Gansta's don't die,  
They get chubby and they move to Miami, I move to Miami  
I'm banned from Wet Willies, but a nigga like fuck it  
I'm still a G, thuggin' out in public, believe it  
Gansta's don't die,  
They get chubby and they move to Miami, I move to Miami  
I'm banned from Wet Willies, but a nigga like fuck it  
I'm still a G, thuggin' out in public, straight up  
  
Yeah  
Nigga playin', doing about one eighty  
Maserati, matchin' drop top sun shade  
Gotta be fly, P-one nigga, spent about five on a condo high in the sky  
G-four whenever, fly in any weather  
Had to pop a few pussies that was bad feathers  
Million on the floor  
Thats fo' sho' that lil' homie got the flow, so we all just goin' float  
And don't think about the past  
A little water came, now we floatin' on everything  
Niggas doing about anything, killin' while they hustlin'  
Niggas puttin' it in for the change  
So we headed to the game, Culpepper gettin' his roll on  
I'm on the side with that bling  
And outside, got them thangs  
Them Phantoms out there, we do it up, switchin' lanes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Na, don't fuck with that dog  
Youngin' 'n' knock your fuckin' head off  
And I'm coming back hard  
Stunner get me to work, and I'm runnin' that off  
I'm comin' back with it, and let my team split it  
With a swagger you can't get, na you can't get it  
Shit, bitch I pop like Diddy,  
I pop like when he goin' stop? When it's empty  
And you still drawing Leonardo D'Vinci  
  
Trap me, I'm in there early, gettin' money ridin' dirty  
Uptown puttin' in down blowin' out the pound  
Duffel bag full of cash when I come around  
The lil' homie got the game so I put him down  
Hold my town, world wide wearin' a crown  
Like father like son, got it off the mound  
Like father like son, niggas stand their grounds  
Like father like son, nigga fuck them clowns  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah nigga,  
Un-fuckin'-believable  
I know y'all hear some more shit about me and my little young nigga  
You know, they mouth like they ass  
Anything will come outta that motherfucker ya' heard me  
Big shouts to all them cities who opened your arms to us nigga  
And let us through that motherfucker, ya' heard me  
Cause that water ran us out that motherfucker, but we did bounce back  
Believe that 3-0-5, 4-0-4, 7-1-3, all that, Dallas, Kansas  
Everybody ya' heard me, Oklahoma, yeah, everybody, the whole world



(Tell me) How long will we grovel at the feet of wealth and power  
(Tell me) How long will we bow down to that golden calf  
How long will be too long  
(Tell me) How long will we curtsy to the whims of new religion  
How long will we water down the truth  
'Til truth is no more  
How long will be too long  
  
[Chorus]  
The power of faith and love  
Can change the stuff we're made of  
But still we wait  
(Tell me) How long will be too long  
  
(Tell me) How long will we drink from the chalice of indifference  
Neither be hot or be cold  
Can a sober soul know  
How long will be too long  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Is there not more to us  
Than cursed dust to dust  
I feel my hope fading  
How long will be too long  
  
How long will be too long  
  
(Tell me) How long will we travel from the ways that God intended  
Won't it all tumble down if His holy wrath comes  
How long will be too long  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The power of faith and love  
Can change the stuff we're made of  
When will it be too late  
How long will be too long  
How long will be too long  
How long will be too long



I prefer to spend my time in solitary ways  
Keeping myself to myself  
Can't pretend that it's been easy since you went away  
Living with somebody else  
  
If you should change your mind  
If you should turn around and look behind  
If you could see me the way I used to be  
At the risk of bringing back the sorrow and despair  
  
I would do it all again  
Holding on to memories and pretending not to care  
Knowing that the show was soon to end  
If only I could change your mind  
  
If only you would change  
If I had the chance I'd do it all again  
I would do it all again  
  
I remember windy shores on menancholy days  
Drifting along with the tide  
And the joy of simple things and ordinary ways  
Taking it all in my stride  
  
If you should change your mind  
If I could let you see what lies behind  
If you could see need me the way it used to be  
  
Even for the moment of the happy times we shared  
Living in my dreams since then  
At the risk of losing only castles in the air  
Come with me and we can try again  
Oh, if I could change your mind  
  
Can't pretend it's been lonely since you went away  
Oh, if I could change your mind



"Lord, Please guide my steps.  
I commit my way to You.  
I wont make a move, until I hear Your voice! "  
  
Don't wanna make a move!  
  
I gotta be on guard cause,  
Who knows what's in the shadows,  
To try and keep me off of this road,  
And lead me astray.  
I want every step to be in the right place  
At the right time!  
So I'm searching for You Lord,  
To guide me every day!  
  
I don't wanna make a move with the faith!  
Don't wanna make a move without the light of truth.  
In the twist and turns along the way,  
I don't, I don't wanna make a move without You!  
  
You got me when I woke up today,  
I was turning through the pages.  
Looking for some Wisdom that might show me  
Where You lead.  
Nothing short of You will satisfy my hunger!  
You can hear me crying out every night,  
From down on my knees!  
  
I don't wanna make a move with the faith!  
Don't wanna make a move without the light of truth.  
In the twist and turns along the way,  
I don't, I don't wanna make a move without You!  
  
In the still and quiet,  
I bow my heart,  
Incline my ear.  
Anything You whisper Lord,  
I want to hear!  
Lord I need to hear You!  
  
I don't wanna make a move with the faith!  
Don't wanna make a move without the light of truth.  
In the twist and turns along the way,  
I don't, I don't wanna make a move without You!  
  
I will follow You,  
Gonna do what You tell me to!  
I need You,  
I will follow you Jesus!



A man's blood runs hot  
As high as the temple will go  
Though we can deny our nature, baby  
It makes us less in control  
  
There's a beautiful lady who breaks in the sand  
With secrets that she only knows  
Oh she gives and she takes with each wave that she makes  
And it's to her that I must go  
  
Cause she settle me down  
Settle me down  
Oh won't you settle me down  
The coolest fever in my blood  
Oh won't you settle me down  
C'mon  
  
Oh it's not my style  
To be afraid  
Of what evil men gon' do  
And I won't live in fear  
I know why I'm here  
Yeah, I'm sheltered and watched after too  
  
'Cause these people put on the fine business suits  
And they step on your face 'til they're going  
Oh, the money, the cursin', when it's time for the hearse  
Only bankers and lawyers are showin'  
  
Come and settle me down  
Settle me down  
Oh won't you settle me down  
  
The coolest fever in my blood  
Oh won't you settle me down  
  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
  
Hey boys,  
Listen right here.  
This ain't ever gonna get on country radio  
I'm tellin' ya'  
You gotta change your style  
  
C'mon  
  
Settle me down  
Settle me down  
Oh won't you settle me down  
The coolest fever in my blood  
Oh won't you settle me down  
  
Settle me down  
Settle me down  
Oh won't you settle me down  
The coolest fever in my blood  
  
Settle me down  
Settle me down  
Oh won't you settle me down  
The coolest fever in my blood  
Oh won't you settle me down



Excuse me  
You're wearing out my joie de vie  
Grabbing those good years again  
I want to be alone  
  
Excuse me  
I'm not the man I used to be  
Someone else crept in again  
I want to be alone  
  
Excuse me please  
I'm looking for Lost Angeles  
Soaking up the sin again  
I want to be alone  
  
You got the money back, that's okay  
Who needs a Cadillac anyway  
I got the medicine, make you see the light  
Call me in Alaska if it all turns out right (Alright)  
  
Excuse me please  
You're standing on my memories  
Stealing souvenirs again  
I want to be alone  
  
Leave me alone, I want to be alone  
(repeated several times)  
  
You got the money back, that's okay  
Who needs a Cadillac anyway  
I got the medicine, make you see the light  
Call me in Alaska, if it all turns out right



Heaven  
  
Oh - thinkin' about all our younger years  
There was only you and me  
We were young and wild and free  
Now nothin' can take you away from me  
We've been down that road before  
But that's over now  
You keep me comin' back for more  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby you're all that I want  
When you're lyin' here in my arms  
I'm findin' it hard to believe  
We're in heaven  
And love is all that I need  
And I found it here in your heart  
It isn't too hard to see  
We're in heaven  
  
Oh - once in your life you find someone  
Who will turn your world around  
Bring you up when you're feelin' down  
Ya-nothin' could change what you mean to me  
Oh there's lots that I could say  
But just hold me now  
Cause our love will light the way  
  
Chorus  
  
I've been waitin' for so long  
For somethin' to arrive  
For love to come along  
Now our dreams are comin' true  
Through the good times and the bad  
Ya - I'll be standin' there by you



Let's put a new coat of paint  
On this lonesome old town  
Set 'em up, we'll be knockin' 'em down  
You wear a dress  
Baby I'll a tie  
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon  
In that burgundy sky  
  
All our scribbled love dreams are lost or thrown away  
Here amidst the shuffle of an overflowin' day  
Our love needs a transfusion let's shoot it full of wine  
Fishin' for a good time starts with throwin' in your line.  
  
So let's put a new coat of paint  
On this lonesome old town  
Set em' up, set em' up we'll be knockin' 'em down  
You wear a dress baby  
I'll wear a tie  
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon  
In that burgundy sky



Storm clouds cruising cross the blue skies  
Shadows float across the fields of barley  
I find myself an island in an island  
I have to sort things out just my way  
  
And all I find is my bar  
To laugh, to me I say  
Like all you know is true  
Is for every time we know it's mine  
  
I saw clouds cruise floating cross the blue sky  
Shadows float across the fields of barley  
Hero down the right way  
Everything will come out my way  
  
Now I know, I see, I find  
It's the only way I ever felt the way I do today  
All I say, I play the game  
I know I never could be sure of all the places that I've seen  
  
Clouds cruising cross the blue skies  
Shadows float across the fields of barley  
Every self an island in an island  
Working every problem out my way  
  
Now I see, I feel, I know  
It's the only way that anything could sort out to the way  
I say you'll find it's out of mind  
It's the only way I could have been  
It's the only way I stand  
  
Clouds cruise  
Float upon the barley

Everytime we say goodbye, I die a little,  
Everytime we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,  
Why the Gods above me, who must be in the know.  
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.  
When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,  
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,  
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to  
Minor,  
Everytime we say goodbye.  
  
When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,  
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,  
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to  
Minor,  
Everytime we say goodbye.



I looked  
I looked up to the sky  
Your face was drawn in black and white  
Tonight we're stuck inside a lie  
The fear is we won't get out alive  
The stink is in the air  
The air is getting thin  
  
Where you goin  
As fast as you can run  
And where you goin  
You hide behind the sun  
Stay down low  
Stay down where you are  
And where you goin  
Is is better than here?  
  
The truth... . how we turned into a joke  
And it's truth IMd give anything to hold  
Tonight, tonight I stay  
But you, you slip away  
  
Where you goin  
As fast as you can run  
And where you goin  
You hide behind the sun  
Stay down low  
Stay down where you are  
And where you goin  
Don't let them come after you  
  
I trip trip trip in vain  
I like to get a away  
You like it like you do  
I like to be with you  
I like to live up there  
But I wake up and I  
I wake up and I  
I wake up and I'm here  
Tonight I am stuck here  
And tomorrow I,  
I disappear  
  
And where you goin  
As fast as you can run  
And where you goin  
You hide behind the sun  
Stay down low  
And stay down where you are  
Cause it's better there  
And it's better than we thought



When he looks into her eyes  
He sees only the truth  
Telling him he's been living a lie  
over and over like a line in a song  
About all the love he let pass by.  
  
To her he might be the man of her dreams  
To find where she's been hiding inside  
Broken or battered, it really doesn't matter  
Her heart's like a wave and he's the tide.  
  
They're not forever they're just for today  
One part be my lover, one part go away.  
  
He's like a boxer who had to retire  
After winning but killing a man  
He's got all the moves and none of the courage  
Afraid to throw a punch that might land.  
  
Not too much later she can't meet his glance  
You see her start pulling away  
Over and over like fire and ice  
One is color, one is grey.  
  
They're not forever, they're just for today  
One part be my lover, one part go away.  
  
So if you know how  
Why don't you say'em a prayer  
They're need all the help they can get  
They remember too much about what went wrong  
It might be they should learn to forget.  
  
Forget themselves in each other  
And leave what belongs in the past  
Carry their hearts like a newborn child  
Cause it's only the moment that lasts.  
  
They're not forever,they're just for today  
One part be my lover,one part go away.



Cracklin' Rosie, get on board  
We're gonna ride till there ain't no more to go  
Taking it slow  
Lord, don't you know  
Have made me a time with a poor man's lady  
  
Hitchin' on a twilight train  
Ain't nothing there that I care to take along  
Maybe a song  
To sing when I want  
Don't need to say please to no man for a happy tune  
  
Oh, I love my Rosie child  
She got the way to make me happy  
You and me, we go in style  
Cracklin' Rose, you're a store bought woman  
You make me sing like a guitar hummin'  
So hang on to me, girl  
Our song keeps runnin' on  
  
Play it now  
Play it now, my baby  
  
Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile  
Girl if it lasts for an hour, that's all right  
We got all night  
To set the world right  
Find us a dream that don't ask no questions, yeah

I can see the things you doing  
And you think that I'm naive  
But when I get the goods on you  
She'll finally believe  
  
She says it's all just drama  
But every bubble's got to pop  
She's gonna see just what your doing  
  
And then you're finally gonna have to stop!  
Don't think you're gonna win this time  
'Cause you better believe I'm gonna drop a dime  
On you  
  
I'll getcha! Yeah! I'll getcha ya!  
And when I do you're gonna be Busted!  
Busted!  
I don't wanna put the hurt on you  
But you better believe me when I tell you  
That I finally got the dirt on you  
  
You're busted! (busted!)  
Yeah, she's finally gonna see the light  
This is how it's gonna be  
When she finds out that I was always right  
  
You're busted!  
  
There's a new cop on the beat  
And I'm bringing down the heat  
My eyes are wise to all your lies, cause you're not that discreet  
And I don't care what you've heard  
'Cause there's one six letter word  
It's gonna set me free  
(Gonna set me free)  
It starts with a b  
(Starts with a b)  
It goes B-U-S-T-E-D you are busted!  
  
I don't wanna put the hurt on you  
But you better believe me when I tell you  
That I finally got the dirt on you  
You're busted  
[Think you're gonna win this time]  
Yeah, she's finally gonna see the light  
[Drop a dime on you]  
This is how it's gonna be  
When she finds out that I was always right  
  
You're busted!



(Ian Hunter)  
  
I can't believe what you did, you know - you just can't let it go  
I'm sick 'n' tired of listening to your innuendo  
I can't believe what you did, you know - you sawed me in half  
When I was at the end of my endurance  
All you did was bite the hand that fed you from the start  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - a little soap 'n' water, na na na na na na - would not
come amiss  
Oh - oh - a little soap 'n' water - a little soap 'n' water, a little soap 'n'
water  
  
I can't believe what you did, why - why you stoop so low  
Why am I the target for your slings and arrows  
I can't believe what you did, when - you showed me no class  
Every mirror tells a different story  
Who gave you the right to be the keeper of my past  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - a little soap 'n' water, na na na na na na - would not
come amiss  
Oh - oh - a little soap 'n' water - a little soap 'n' water, we're gonna have
to wash your mouth out if you persist  
  
You know, I was never loyal to you - you were never loyal to me  
We were both loyal to the cause  
That cause died - there was nothing left inside  
It ain't my fault, let it - it ain't your fault - let it ride  
  
I can't believe what you did, you know - you know how to hurt  
All you do is drag old memories through the dirt  
I can't believe what you did - you show no mercy  
Yesterday don't last until tomorrow  
My oh my, what a pitiful cry - you're your own worst enemy  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - a little soap 'n' water, na na na na na na - would not
come amiss  
Oh - oh - a little soap 'n' water - a little soap 'n' water, we're gonna have
to wash your mouth out if you persist  
  
I got just what you need, I got just what you need  
I got just what you need, I got just what you need  
I got just what you need, I got just what you need  
I got just what you need



Hi out there. This is Shaun Goldberg and you're listening to W-A-N-K  
This evening I've got someone really interesting with me.  
He's over from old England and his name is Robbie Williams.  
  
Cor blimey bleedin' Mary Poppins!  
  
Great, right on! You know we've been hearing about this boy band that was
really big over there.  
Can you tell us a little bit about it Robbie?  
  
First of all, I'd like to say thank you very much for having me in the first
place  
but to answer your question I can't really answer it.  
I suppose it was a bit like this  
  
Ha  
Riding in your limos  
Hanging with your bimbos  
Riding my old faithful  
Bigger pin-up than Betty Grable  
Kipper in the papers  
Coke and whisky chasers  
I ain't supposed to pose  
But I don't care  
  
I was a teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Services for Britain  
Pouting like a kitten  
Dinner with Diana  
I'm a social Stokey spanner  
Waiting for my knighthood  
She can pin it on my manhood  
I ain't supposed to pose  
But I don't care  
  
I was a teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
Yeah, yeah  
A teenage millionaire  
  
(It works out sometimes it's funny  
Being stupid makes you lots of money)  
  
Bothered Judy Garland  
When I ordered Barbara Cartland  
Champagne in my bidet  
The press all had a field day  
You may think it's an outrage  
My cleaner is wearing bondage  
She makes my place a mess  
But I don't care  
  
I was a teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
A teenage millionaire  
Yeah, yeah  
A teenage millionaire  
  
Come on waif  
It looks as if you need a good feeling



I've made up my mind I've packed my bags  
I'm not returning home, until someone will give me reason to  
I lock the door and take a breath  
I'm ready to let go, I know you're somewhere out there too  
There's only one thing for me to do and I go  
  
[Chorus]  
Over the mountains and over the sea  
To find a heart that belongs to me  
Anywhere in the world I go  
Anywhere 'til I find you  
I run through the valleys  
I run through the fields  
I'd do anything I am hard to please  
And anywhere in the world I go  
Anywhere 'til I find you  
  
I fly like the wind, I don't know where my heart will lead the way  
I need someone to love and hold on to  
But the road is long I've had my doubts  
But nothing lets me down cause  
I know you're somewhere out there too waiting for me to get to you and I go...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It doesn't matter what  
The time will tell  
'Cause I will be here waiting  
For you, for you and me  
It doesn't matter what the others say  
Cause I will keep on searching  
And I go and I go and I go and I go  
  
[Chorus: x2]



Over there in India a Hindoo resides smoking his hoakam all day  
Opium and bits of rope and fag ends besides, a wise man from the East
Whitechapel way.  
He's got a lovely palace on the beach  
He's the Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
He's got twelve bedrooms with eight wives in each,  
He's the Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
  
He's got one wife who wears a veil, it covers half her face,  
From her nose right to her toes you'll see nothing else but space.  
She'll dance and waggle her "San Fairy Ann"  
For the Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
  
He practices his magic in the Eastern bazaar  
Slave girls come under his spell  
When he puts on the fluence,  
They don't know where they are  
He does Indian tricks and dirty tricks as well.  
Now what he fancies always does him good  
He's the Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
  
He lives on rice, roast beef and Yorkshire pud  
He's the Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
He wears a dishcloth round his waist,  
His favourite wife called Nellie  
Said, "You'd look well if the darned thing fell  
You'd have nowt to cover your...  
He said "Who cares, I could always wear a fan  
I'm a Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
  
He looks just like a Nabob of renown  
He's the Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man  
A Nabob, two bob, three bob, half a crown.  
He's a Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo man.  
A Princess brought him jewels and said  
"For all your love I yearn"  
But jewels could not compare with what  
He went and gave her in return.  
He's ninety nine, but he does all he can.  
For a Hindoo, Howdoo, Hoodoo, Yoodoo Man.



I've been through so many changes in my life  
It's a wonder I ain't lost my mind  
And I ain't never said how much I need you sugar  
But I sure need you by my side  
  
[Chorus]  
My love, just thinking about you baby  
Just blows my mind  
My love, just thinking about you baby  
Just blows my mind all the time  
  
Life with me I know for sure it ain't be easy  
But you stayed with me anyway  
And even though you ain't gonna lose too much by leaving  
I'm so glad you stayed  
  
My love, just thinking about you baby  
Just blows my mind  
My love, just thinking about you baby  
Just blows my mind all the time  
  
You've been my friend and you've been my lover  
Honey you're everything I need  
You've made my love so strong now I know where I belong  
Oh you'll never have to worry  
Oh baby any more, any more  
  
My love, just thinking about you baby  
Just blows my mind, oh yeah  
My love, just thinking about you baby  
Just blows my mind, all the time



I betcha my heart I love ye I betcha my dreams are of ye  
That's why I sing so loud I'm floatin' on the cloud I betcha my heart I love

I woke up this morning so early remembered your hair was curly  
I rolled over and then I dreamed of you again I betcha my heart I love ye

When you're close to me it's just like TNT I betcha my heart I love ye  
Well I betcha my heart I love ye... (yodel)  
  
  



Would you like to take  
This magic potion with me  
On a trip to a cosmic  
Playground far beyond  
She understands  
She's been before  
It's in her hands  
To find the door  
  
Sweet Lorraine  
Let the party carry on  
You and I will swim the sea  
Sweet Lorraine  
Let the party carry on  
You and I can feel the breeze  
  
There is no time, no wealth  
Only I surround you  
The fortune of this guide  
Is simply sincerity  
She understands  
'Cause she's been before  
It's in her hands  
To find the door, so

Face in the gutter eyes on the floor  
Knocked down twice can't take it no more  
You got no vision in your head  
You got no vision better dead  
Get on your feet open the door  
  
Walk on down you know the score  
It's a dead-end street back to the wall  
You get it together you can get it all  
  
The weak will fall the strong remain  
  
No pain no gain (yeah)  
No pain no gain (yeah)  
  
No time for losers you make the call  
Believe in yourself stand tall  
Another day it's in your hand  
You can be the winner in the end  
  
The weak will fall the strong remain  
  
No pain no gain (yeah)  
No pain no gain  
No pain no gain (yeah)  
No pain no gain (yeah, yeah)  
  
Keep runnin' don't look back  
Keep movin' paint it black  
Keep goin' don't ever stop  
There's time to rest the day you'll drop  
  
You roll the dice you play the game

No pain no gain

Round and round



In my heart is where I long for you  
In my smile I search for you  
Each time you turn and run away I cry inside  
My silly way, just too young to know any more  
  
In my world the devil dances and dares  
To leave my soul just anywhere,  
Until I find peace in this world  
I'll sing a song everywhere I can  
Just too young to know any more  
  
The wind covers me cold  
The starry skies all around my eyes  
Far behind the city moans  
Well worthy of the people there  
Oh, the psalms they love to hear  
  
So let me sing a song for you  
Just to help your day along  
Let me sing a song for you  
One I've known so very long  
Oh, please could you find the time.

And if I had some time later in the day to  
Do something for your love

But maybe by now she'll see things my way  
And ask me to say to  
Do something for her love

Feat. The Buddy Cole Trio  
  
In a little Spanish town  
Twas on a night like this  
Stars were peek-a-booing down  
Twas on a night like this  
  
I whispered, be true to me  
And she sighed, si, si  
  
Many skies have turned to gray  
Because we're far apart  
Many moons have passed away  
And still, she's in my heart  
  
We made a promise  
And we sealed it with a kiss  
In a little Spanish town  
Twas on a night like this  
  
Many skies have turned to gray  
Because we're far apart  
Many moons have passed away  
And still, she's in my heart  
  
We made a promise  
And we sealed it with a kiss  
In a little Spanish town  
Twas on a night like this



The sun came into view  
As I sat with the tears in my eyes  
The sun came up on you  
And as you smiled, the teardrop, it dried  
  
I don't know where I had been  
But I know what I have seen  
Made me chill right to the bone  
Made me wish that I'd stayed home along with you  
  
Tired of midnight blues  
  
The sun came up so high  
And as it shone, I realized your love  
The sun shone in your eyes  
And as you smiled, you realized it too  
  
Don't know where I had been  
But I know what I have seen  
Made me chill right to the bone  
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you  
  
Tired of midnight blues  
  
Don't know where I had been  
But I know what I have seen  
Made me chill right to the bone  
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you  
  
Tired of midnight blues  
  
The sun went down the sky  
Way up the clouds told me that they knew  
The moon came up so high  
And as you smiled, I knew that you knew too  
  
Don't know where I had been  
But I know what I have seen  
Made me chill right to the bone  
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you  
  
Tired of midnight blues  
  
I don't know where I had been  
But I know what I have seen  
Made me chill right to the bone  
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you



It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, seen ya picture  
Now they wanna grab a gun and come and getcha  
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, seen ya picture  
Now they wanna grab a gun and come and getcha  
One time for the homie dj screw  
Already I'm feelin' throwed in this bitch  
  
I'm so high even when I'm comin' down  
Just met a girl, said she from the H-Town  
I said my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer  
A cup inside a cup smokin' ghost face killah  
Got these boppers goin' crazy  
  
Nigga, I'm the man, I sent your girl message  
Said I see you when I can  
She send me one back but I ain't never read it  
'Cause pussies only pussy and I get it when I need it and  
  
I'm tellin' you when homies runnin' down in the winter  
And I be riding rims with tires in it thinner  
Air force stun fly charters over seas full of Don Perian  
And the water for the D's  
  
Don't know why it happens every time we alone  
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone  
So I'ma sip this drink till that motherfucker gone  
Than you go get undressed and we gon' get it on  
  
I don't give you the time you deserve from me  
This is something I know, I know, I know  
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston  
Taking everything slow so slow, so slow but I do it to her  
  
Draped up and dripped out know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
Three in the morning get it poppin' in the parking lot  
It's on once again and I never pretend  
A nigga stay G till the end, yeah  
  
I swear like every time we find ourself in this situation  
I just get that feeling like I mean Houston candy paint  
Switching colors in the light, it's about like 11 P. M.  
And you just roaming through the city bumpin' that screw  
  
Big Mo, ugk, Lil Keke  
It feel like everything just moving slow  
Let's take my time, I pace it, baby  
Yeah, I'm gone



Today tomorrow seems so far away and the wait in vain  
So safe in the blinding light of love unchained in yesterday's grave  
  
The truth that could set souls free  
Is buried within sweet pandemonium  
Concealed by disbelief  
The riddle stays veiled in sweet pandemonium  
  
Afraid that everything remains unchanged in this fragile dream  
Ashamed of the shattered remains of promises made  
  
Drained by the anger and grief  
Fazed by the envy and greed  
The secret cries for a release  
The lucidity hidden deep in sweet pandemonium



I walk the street at night  
until the morning light comes shining through  
Can't get a good night's sleep  
ain't been to work in weeks  
  
What am I gonna do?  
Help me  
  
Can't get her off my mind  
I'm drinking too much wine  
I'm burning up inside  
If I could touch her face  
or take her out some place I'd be satisfied  
  
Hey, I'm a loaded gun  
I'm crazy about her, crazy about her  
Hey, I'm a lovesick son  
I'm crazy about her  
  
I see her jogging in Central Park  
with one of them Walkman's on her head  
She was hot, young, beautiful  
and I said to myself  
she's destined to be mine  
  
I see her every day  
in rush hour or subway, in a grocery store  
She don't notice me  
I might as well just be a crockroach on the floor  
  
If she belonged to me I'd give her everything  
I'd never cheat or lie  
I treat her with respect, not just a sex object  
I ain't that kind of guy  
  
Hey, I'm a loaded gun  
I'm crazy about her, crazy about her  
Hey, I'm a lovesick son  
I'm crazy about her  
  
I was standing outside the Met one day  
when she drove by in a black Corvette  
I said Hey baby  
I could've died, she looked straight through me  
But I know she's destined to be mine  
  
Every night I stand around her door and wait for her to come by  
She lives in one of those brownstones with the guard outside  
and the limousines and the Rolls Royces comin' and goin'  
  
My friends all say she's way outta my class  
but I know if she'd just get know me  
I could give her something all those rich guys ain't got  
  
Ain't gonna bide my time ain't gonna stand in line  
Somebody gonna get burned  
But, oh the problem is I think my love's at risk  
She's the boss's girl  
Oh no  
  
Hey, I'm a loaded gun  
I'm crazy about her, crazy about her  
Hey, I'm a lovesick son  
I'm crazy about her



In the twilight glow I see you  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
When we kissed goodbye and parted  
I knew we'd never meet again  
Love is like a dying ember  
And only memories remain  
  
And through the ages I remember  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
  
Someday, when we meet up yonder  
We'll stroll hand in hand again  
In a land that knows no parting  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
Love is like a dying ember  
And only memories remain  
  
And through the ages I remember  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain



Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo  
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo  
  
Sweet woman what's your name?  
You smell as fresh as the rain  
Instead of leaving you came  
Let me feel your hair  
  
A light shines in your eyes  
The hungry years are so nice  
Shadows shake in the lamplight  
No writer could explain  
  
But when the daylight comes  
But when the daylight comes  
But when the daylight comes  
I'll be on my way  
  
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo  
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo  
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo, yeah!  
  
Please share my bed and I swear  
That I won't touch you nowhere  
Just need your warmth and your care  
Don't want to mess around  
  
And when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Oh when the daylight comes  
I'll be on my way  
  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
I'll be on my way  
  
But there's a song in the air  
And it knows that you're there  
'Cause it's making me share  
You with my life  
I know I know I know that  
I want to weave you in words  
Want to paint you in verse  
Want to leave you in someone else's dreams  
It seems the only way, Hey!  
I can thank you, thank you baby  
  
Some people say that we're sinners  
Some people say that we're winners  
We make good gossip at dinners  
They try to pin us down  
  
But when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Oh when the daylight comes  
I'll be on my way  
  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Oh when the daylight comes  
We'll be on my way

If you think I want the life you choose to live  
I don't think I want the love you've got to give  
If you think my goals could be so trivial and small  
Then, I don't think you know me at all  
Born between the covers of your fashion books  
You think you can make it, girl, on just your looks  
But you could never bring me up  
Between us stands a wall  
No, I don't think you know me at all  
Believing in the promise painted in your smile  
I've chased what I was running from, girl, all my life  
I've known you a hundred times in memories I recall, but  
I don't think you know me at all  
I don't think you know me at all.  



The head of a hunt on the wall by a painting  
An upright piano stood locked by the door  
In through the window  
The light was fast fading  
While I split my whiskey  
All over the floor  
Making a mess of my words so  
I was trying  
To impress the Empress with  
My wimpy tales  
Fanning her face from cigar smoke  
And sighing  
I had come close to be miles  
From her trail  
  
She was the jewel that  
Sparkled in darkness  
She was the love  
Of everyone's life  
She was the catch at  
Everyone's parties  
She was the one with a tongue  
Like a knife  
  
Her bosoms curved perfectly  
Lit by the fire  
My mind launched away  
In a sea of its own  
Her grace and her tightness  
I had to admire  
Through a whore's breath of stories  
I happily told  
  
Trespassing my hand  
Fell into hot water  
She shot like a bullet  
Right out of her chair  
She led me away and I  
Was then slaughtered  
By the warmth of her body  
And her love and care  
  
Her tongue cut away  
And the wounds slowly opened  
I lay on the sails of the  
Ship of romance  
Drunk as I could be and  
Broker than broken and  
The head of my hunt  
Was there in my hands



If you're fond of sand dunes and salty air,  
Quaint little villages here and there,  
You're sure to fall in love with old cape cod.  
  
If you like the taste of a lobster stew  
Served by a window with an ocean view,  
You're sure to fall in love with old cape cod.  
  
Winding roads that seem to beckon you.  
Miles of green beneath the skies of blue.  
Church bells chimin' on a Sunday morn  
Remind you of the town where you were born.  
  
If you spend an evening you'll want to stay,  
Watching the moonlight on old cape cod bay.  
You're sure to fall in love with old cape cod.  
  
You're sure to fall in love, in love, in love.  
You're sure to fall in love, in love,  
With old cape cod, old cape cod.



Hold on my heart  
Just hold on to that feeling  
We both know we've been here before  
We both know what can happen  
  
Hold on my heart  
'cause I'm looking over you shoulder  
Please don't rush in this time  
Don't show her how you feel  
  
Hold on my heart  
Throw me a lifeline  
I'll keep a place for you  
Somewhere deep inside  
  
Hold on my heart  
Please tell her to be patient  
'Cause there has never been a time  
That I wanted something more  
  
If I can recall this feeling  
And I know there's a chance  
Oh I will be there  
Yes I will be there  
Be there for you  
Whenever you want me to  
Whenever you call I will be there  
Yes I will be there  
  
Hold on my heart  
Don't let her see you crying  
No matter where I go  
She'll always be with me  
  
Hold on my heart  
Just hold on to that feeling  
We both know we've been here before  
We both know what can happen  
So hold on my heart

You can go but be back soon  
You can go but while you're working,  
This place I'm pacing round,  
Until you're home safe and sound  
Fare well but be back soon  
Who can tell where danger's lurking  
Do not forget this tune,  
Be back soon!  
  
How could we forget  
How could we let  
Our dear old Fagin worry  
We love him so we'll come back home  
In a such a great big hurry  
  
It's him who plays the piper,  
It's the one that pipes his tune!  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
You can go but be back soon,  
You can go but bring back plenty,  
Of pocket hankerchieves  
And you should be clever thieves  
Whip it quick and be back soon  
There's a sixpence here for twenty  
Ain't that a lovely tune,  
Be back soon!  
  
Our pockets'll hold a watch of gold  
That chimes upon the hour!  
A wallet fat  
An old man's hat,  
  
The crown jewels from the tower!  
We know the bow street runners,  
But they don't know this tune,  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
Cheerio but be back soon,  
I don't know somehow I'll miss yya

Say cheerio not goodbye  
Don't be gone long be back soon  
Give me one long last god bless ya  
Remember our old tune,  
Be back soon!  
  
We must disappear, we'll be back here  
Today perhaps tomorrow  
We'll miss you too,  
  
It's sad but true  
That picking  
Is such sweet sorrow!  
  
And when we're in the distance,  
You'll hear this whispered tune,  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
We must disappear  
We'll be back here  
Today perhaps tomorrrow

That parting is such sweet sorrow!  
And when we're in the distance  
You'll hear this whispered tune,

Black is beautiful, white is so pure  
Can you see a difference? all I see's a blur  
Is one color a virtue how can you be sure  
Ignorance the disease education the cure  
  
So how can you say that your proud of your race  
Proud of your gender  
Or proud of your faith  
Facism racism all starts out the same  
Stop feeding the fire and smother the flame  
  
Some people are smarter than others so dumb  
The reason behind this a cultural one  
And greatness isn't carried by blood  
So get off your high horse  
You're no better than us  
All seems infected that the infected spy  
As all looks yellow to the jaundiced eye  
You're the infected you can never deny  
You're arrogant, you're insolent, you're living a lie

Round about midnight  
I feel the chill closin' in  
Living my stage fright  
I need the sun to begin - tomorrow  
  
Thinking 'bout my life  
And all the changes she made  
And when she went running out  
All the colors fade - to midnight  
  
[Chorus:]  
What a bad week I've had  
There's rain on the window  
What a bad week I'm sad  
There's rain on my window  
  
Will I be staying  
Or am I moving in  
Am I still standing  
I've gotta wait - she's choosing  
  
[Chorus]  
What a bad week I've had  
There's rain on the window  
What a bad week I'm sad  
There's rain on the window  
  
When the sun comes up, it dries that rain on the window [Repeat: x5]



Tenement slum  
  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ah  
  
You think that I don't feel love  
But what I feel for you is real love  
In other's eyes I see reflected  
A hurt, scorned and rejected  
  
Love child, never meant to be  
Love child, born in poverty  
Love child, never meant to be  
Love child, take a look at me  
  
I started my life in an old, cold run down tenement slum  
My father left  
He never even married mom  
I shared the guilt my mama knew  
So afraid that others knew I had no name  
  
This love we're contemplating  
Is worth the pain of waiting  
We'll only end up hating  
The child we maybe creating  
  
Love child, never meant to be  
Love child, scorned by society  
Love child, always second best  
Love child, different from the rest  
  
Hold on  
Hold on (Ooooooohhh)  
  
I started school, in a worn, torn,  
Dress that somebody threw out  
I knew the way it felt, to always live in doubt  
To be without the simple things  
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me  
  
Don't think that I don't need you  
Don't think I don't wanna please you  
No child of mine 'll be bearing  
The name of shame I've been wearing  
  
Love child, never quite as good  
Afraid  
Ashamed  
Misunderstood  
  
But I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
I'll always love you  
You-ooo-ooo  
You-ooo-ooo  
You-ooo-ooo

One of these days and it won't be long  
You're gonna look for me an' I'll be gone  
'Cause (I believe, yes I believe)  
Said I believe right now  
I believe, yes I believe  
Oh, I believe to my soul  
Tryin' to make a fool out of me  
  
I believe it!  
(I believe it)  
  
Oh, goin' 'round here wit' yo' head so hard, huh  
I think I'm gonna have to use my rod  
'Cause I believe (I believe) yes I (believe)  
Said I believe right now (I believe) yes I (believe)  
Whoa-oh, I believe to my soul  
Tryin' to make a fool outta me  
  
(I believe it)  
(I believe it)  
  
Last night I was dreamin' and I got your plan  
Saw you an' your girlfriend walkin' hand in hand  
That's why I believe (I believe, I believe)  
Said I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)  
Whoa-whoa, I believe to my soul  
Tryin' to make a fool outta me

Last night I was dreamin' an' I dug your plan  
Saw you an' your girlfriend walkin' hand in hand  
And I believe, I believe yes (I believe)  
Said I believe right now (I believe, yes I believe)  
Whoa-whoa, I believe to my soul  
Tryin' to make a fool outta me  
  
I believe it!



Latley I've been spendin' lots of time with my kid  
Tellin' him stories  
About the things that we did  
When we were a family  
  
Long time ago  
I've answerd his questions  
'Til I'm blue in the face  
Wish all that hurt in him  
  
I could erase  
But I tell him the truth  
Cause he ain't to young to know  
  
[Chorus]  
Single father  
Part time mother  
When I'm not one  
Then I'm the other  
You used to be  
My full time lover  
Now I'm a single father  
And a part time mother  
I spend every minute  
I can with my boy  
There's no doubt about it  
He's my pride and joy  
  
Someday he will grow up  
And I won't have him no more  
Some things I just find  
Too hard to explain  
  
So we go to mcdonalds  
Or I buy him a train  
And we go put it together  
On the living room floor  
  
Such is the life  
Of a single father  
He says daddy explain  
If it's not too much bother  
  
While its just you and me  
Living here in this home  
I don't understand it  
And neither does he  
  
Why there's just two  
When there should be three of us  
Sharing this moment  
Lord I feel so alone  
  
[Chorus]



You've left my ring by the soap,  
Now is that love?  
You cleaned me out you could say broke,  
Now is that love?  
The better better better it gets  
The more these girls forget  
That that is love.  
You won't get dressed you walk about,  
Now is that, is that  
A teasing glance has pushed me out,  
Now is that, is that  
The tougher tougher tougher it gets  
The more my lips frequent  
Now that is love.  
Beat me up with your letters, your walk out notes,  
Funny how you still find me right here at home.  
Legs up with a book and a drink,  
Now is that love that's making you think.  
You've called my bluff I'm not so hot,  
Now is that love  
My assets froze while yours have dropped,  
Now is that, is that  
It's the cupid cupid cupid disguise  
That more or less survived  
Now that is love.  
Beat me up with your letters, your walk out notes,  
Funny how you still find me right here at home.  
Legs up with a book and a drink,  
Now is that love that's making you think.  
You've made my bed the finger points  
Now is that, is that love  
The more you more you more you cool down  
The easier love is found  
Now that is love.  



It's so hard to be someone,  
It's so hard to be unkwown.  
In your heart you are to blame  
In your heart you play the game.  
  
Do you realize you pay the price?  
Do you know the cost of all your vice?  
Save your soul, it's all a test,  
Save your soul, it's for the best.  
  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
  
Save your soul, little sister  
Save your soul, dear little brother.  
You need hope, says the preacher,  
Learn to cope says all my teachers.  
  
Do you really know God's intention?  
Do you ever ask what it's all for?  
We need love, love and love,  
We need more, more and more.  
  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
  
Prophets are telling us  
We're near the end  
But I am telling you  
That it's all pretend.  
  
It's so cool to be uncool,  
It's so right to be unright.  
It's so good to look so bad,  
Isn't this the best thing you ever had.  
  
It's so cool to be uncool,  
It's so right to be unright.  
It's so good to look so bad,  
Isn't this the best thing you ever had.  
  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)  
We need love (love, love, love, love, love)



There is an ancient party at the other end of town  
And he keeps a little grocery store, the ancients name is Brown  
And he has a lovely daughter, such a treat I never saw  
Oh I only hope someday to be the old man's son-in-law.  
  
Well, Old Brown he sells from off his shelf most anything you please  
He's got juice tarts for the little boys, lollipops and cheese  
And his daughter minds the store, and it's a treat just to see her serve  
I'd like to run away with her but I don't have the nerve  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's old Brown's daughter is a proper sort of girl,  
Old Brown's daughter is a fair as any pearl  
I wish I were a Lord Mayor, a Marquis or and Earl  
And blow me if I wouldn't marry old Brown's girl.  
Blow me if I wouldn't marry old Brown's girl.  
  
Well, poor old Brown now has trouble with the gout,  
He grumbles in his little parlor when he can't get out  
Oh and when I make a purchase, lord, and she hands me the change  
That girl she makes pulverized, I feel so very strange  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But Miss Brown she smiles so sweetly when I say a tender word  
Ah but old brown says that she must wed a Marquis or a Lord,  
And I don't suppose it's ever one of those things I will be  
But by jingo next election I will run for Trinity  
  
[Chorus]



Darling you can count on me  
Till the sun dries up the sea  
Until then I'll always be  
Devoted to you  
  
I'll be yours through endless time  
I'll adore your charms sublime  
Guess by now you know that I'm  
Devoted to you  
  
I'll never hurt you  
I'll never lie  
I'll never be untrue  
I'll never give you reason to cry  
I'd be unhappy if you were blue  
  
Through the years my love will grow  
Like a river it will flow  
It can't die because I'm so  
Devoted to you  
  
I'll never hurt you  
I'll never lie  
I'll never be untrue  
I'll never give you reason to cry  
I'd be unhappy if you were blue  
  
Through the years my love will grow  
Like a river it will flow  
It can't die because I'm so  
Devoted to you  



Tux on, tux on, tux on, tux on, tux on  
He has eyes down at the bingo on that lucky Friday night  
The match was rained off Saturday but the panel came in bright  
And on Sunday your mates were toasting you with champagne down the pub  
  
And on Monday you went to London  
To pick the cheque up with your mum  
You had a tux on, you had a tux on  
The first time you had a tux on, lucky man  
  
There's a photo on the mantelpiece, when you bought your first guitar  
And your girlfriend came to see you when you were the rising star  
You knew your luck was holding when you filled the local hall  
The first time and the last time that you thought you had control  
  
You had a tux on, lucky man, you had a tux on  
You got a tux on, tux on  
Now you're touring stadiums, you've let it go too far  
Standing with your manager, your back to every bar  
  
Burning all your credit cards, chopping out the pain  
Crowding into toilets with a host of your new-found friends  
You got a tux on, nothing's changed, you got a tux on  
Lucky man with a tux on, you're still the same with a tux on  
  
It was eyes down in the parlour, they prayed it wouldn't rain  
A brother pulled his cuffs down to hide the blue-black vein  
His razor'd more than lines out, they found him just too late  
The final performance, the main man lies in state  
  
With a tux on, look at him now with a tux on  
The last time with a tux on, take him away with a tux on  
Somewhere in a tenement, in a well-thumbed magazine  
Someone finds a photograph that triggers of a dream  
  
The uniform that symbolises the comfortable life  
He's always known his luck's in but now he's found the drive  
He's got a tux on, look at him now with a tux on  
He's gonna get one with a tux on, free admission with a tux on  
  
Get it anyway with a tux on  
He's got a tux on the easy way with a tux on, tux on



I let go of the world that was holding  
A passenger that could not fly  
In search of souls  
Souls in search of something  
Let it go  
Let it slide  
When I find out what went on  
I'll bring it back  
It won't be easy  
They won't believe how a man  
He could drown  
In a starseed  
I hoped to find why this world wasn't glowing  
Glowing it darkens as we end this ride  
I've fallen back under the equator  
I'm back inside, I'm back inside  
When I find out what went on  
I'll bring it back but it won't be easy  
They won't believe the man he could  
But I'd choose starseed over nothing  
Nothing



Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on  
Our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the yuletide gay  
From now on  
Our troubles will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us, once more  
  
Through the years  
We all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star  
Upon the highest bough  
And have yourself  
A merry little christmas right now  
  
Have yourself a  
A merry little christmas now  
  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us, once more  
  
Through the years  
We all will be together  
If the fates allow  
So hang a shining star  
Upon the highest bough  
A merry little christmas now



[Chorus]  
I was on the block picturing blocks at fifteen  
I remember underage drinking at sixteen  
Then my nuts in Cali banging at seventeen  
Now I got everything, bitch, I got everything  
  
My back was to the wall, visited all, after all, all I had was me  
Just tenacity, so we all leave with a sense of sweet  
Then everything I write around got a cotton seat  
Fuck y'all dry, saw off and done rapidly  
Partner, now let's be honest, ain't got no good intentions  
The upper tune is the dudes moving in my position  
But I'm a heavy, wait humble, hitting the heavy bag  
Waiting for the day I stumble across your fucking ass  
Instead I push the work in, chin up and chest out  
Picking the shit up where I left off  
You went soft intention too tenant to deal with the Los Angel  
I admit it, I bull shit and gave you the wrong angle  
Now I have a seat at my table, let me do you the business  
Diversify you millions, you can leave off the entrance  
Make every revenue street flood to where it took me  
And make that money stack higher than giraffes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to have a Glock that I would shot to at backpack  
So it will leave no shells at the scene  
Where I was getting my kid back  
Yeah, this for the homie whack, rolled to and chopped up  
On hard to make the west defined a united fund  
Beard big, light it up, waiting on that vending truck  
So I can crush the corner, welcome to California  
Where people fake it 'till they make it  
Or take it with their hand gun  
Take your chances, swing, try to land one  
Now you're in the box like a sand some, I march to the madness  
My symphony deliver something classic  
Either you ain't glad or you blast it, jumped in or dragged it  
Either way, you got to salute the flag, who you want it with?  
I acknowledge honest with whole heart and integrity  
People keep telling me I'm about to catch a felony  
Stage presence, reminiscent of my flash back  
Gave my girl a son and my last name  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Motherfucker, I live in room that look like a drive-in  
When I open my eyes a bunch of bitches play violins  
Nothing but respect when I walk to the lights in  
Because I kill everything, bitch, I kill everything  
Nothing ever compares with the spring of a free mind  
Find the most dangerous weapon ever acquired by mankind  
Using to fight for your freedom and oppress your oppressors  
You mold them and lead them, fuck the positive message  
This is a lifetime allegiance, boy, you're down to the essence  
There's no payment for passage, my immaculate presence  
Make every revenue street flood, look where it took me  
And make that money stack high and you run a pussy  
  
[Chorus]



There's nothing left for me of days that used to be  
There's just a memory among my souvenirs  
  
Some letters tied in blue, a photograph or two  
I see a rose from you among my souvenirs  
  
A few more tokens rest within my treasure chest  
And though they do their best to give me consolation  
  
I count them all apart and as the teardrops start  
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs  
  
I count them all apart and as the teardrops start  
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs



I wish that I could fly  
Into the sky  
So very high  
Just like a dragonfly  
  
I'd fly above the trees  
Over the seas in all degrees  
To anywhere I please  
  
Oh I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Oh I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Let's go and see the stars  
The milky way or even Mars  
Where it could just be ours  
  
Let's fade into the sun  
Let your spirit fly  
Where we are one  
Just for a little fun  
Oh oh oh yeah !  
  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
I got to get away  
Feel I got to get away  
Oh oh oh yeah  
  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yeah with you yeah yeah  
Oh Yeah !  
  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yeah with you yeah yeah  
I got to get away  
  
I want to get away X4  
Yeah  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yeah with you yeah yeah  
I got to get away  
  
I want to get away X4  
Yeah  
  
I want to get away  
I want to fly away  
Yeah with you  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah



I'm cruising fast on a motorcycle  
down this winding country road  
And I pass the gravel on the foot of the hill  
where last week I fell off  
  
There's still some oil by the old elm tree  
and a dead squirrel that I hit  
But if I hadn't left, I would have struck you dead  
so I took a ride instead  
  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
  
My doctor says, she hopes I know  
how lucky I can be  
after all it wasn't my blood  
mixed in the dirt that night  
  
But this violent rage, turned inward  
can not be helped by drink  
And we must really examine this and I say  
I need another drink  
  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
  
I'm tearing down Route 80 east  
the sun's on my right side  
I'm drunk, but my vision's good  
and I think of my child bride  
And on the left in shadows  
I see something that makes me laugh  
I aim that bike at the fat pothole  
beyond that underpass  
  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out



Oh don't say those same idle lies  
I've heard them before  
This fool who left his heart on an early train  
Won't buy no more  
  
Oh no don't use  
Those same weeping eyes  
Ill wipe them no more  
I didn't want to have to be cruel  
But the truth must be said  
And you ain't heard enough  
  
Oh it was not so long ago  
Since you wandered out of here  
To become a silver model  
Of a city on the air  
So don't choke me with your lies  
Because this man has open eyes  
And I can see  
I can see I can tell  
  
I had it enough  
All those sneaky bars and smart parties  
Had enough  
All those sweet friends and lovers  
I've I've had enough  
All those lonely rooms  
And blank faces  
Had enough  
And I want you I want you no more  
I want you I want you no more  
  
Oh don't say those same idle lies  
I've heard them before  
This fool who left his heart on an early train  
Won't buy no more



[Verse 1]  
Crying up above, I'm just here to take you away  
Don't worry 'bout a thing, I'm just focused on you today  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You're laid out  
You were raised up in a poor town  
Roll up, baby roll up  
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now  
Paris and London (on top of the world)  
Baby we're so down (will you be my girl?)  
Something I wanna say  
Yeah, you know I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
  
[Verse 2]  
I see my phone ring, hope it's you babe  
You sent me a picture, well I sent one too  
I'm just tryna keep this love on track  
Oh babe, I got your heart and I won't give it back  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You're laid out  
You were raised up in a poor town  
Roll up, baby roll up  
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now  
Paris and London (on top of the world)  
Baby we're so down (will you be my girl?)  
Something I wanna say  
Yeah, you know I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
  
[Bridge]  
Holding you close to my heart  
Uh, yeah, so I'm laid back in the Maybach  
Damn these seats go way back  
I was thinking about way back  
When we used to say that  
I was yours, you were mine  
And we fought to pass the time  
And I realized, I realized, that we  
(Babe) no matter what  
(Babe) no matter what  
(Babe) no matter what (oh)  
Babe, babe, babe, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart



Ci vuole qualche cosa  
Qualche cosa di piu'  
Ci vuole un po' di pushing pushing  
Quando il sole va', il sole va' giu'  
Ci vedi qualche cosa  
Di positivo in un no  
Ci vuole un po' di catching funky  
Quando il sole no, il sole non ho  
Oh yeah yeah  
Ci vuole qualcheduno  
Che mi ami di piu'  
Ci vuole un po' di pushing pushing  
Quando il sole va', il sole va' giu'  
Ci vuole un'altra cosa  
Forse un'Ave Maria  
Ci vuole un po' di mercy mercy  
Quando il sole va', il sole va' via  
Baby don't cry  
Make it funky  
Pane e vino io ti portero'  
Miele e venere su dai campi  
Che c'ho l'anima nel fondo del Po  
Ci vuole quella cosa  
Che ci manca di piu'  
Che siamo quasi tutti ai frutti  
Quando il sole va', il sole va' giu'  
Ma vedi qualche cosa  
Di positivo in un mai  
Ci vuole un po' di mercy mercy  
Quando il sole no, il sole non hai  
Baby, don't cry  
Make it funky  
Pane e vino io ti portero'  
Miele e venere su dai campi  
Che c'ho l'anima nel fondo del Po  
Baby, don't cry  
Make it funky  
Pane e vino portero' x te  
Miele e venere x tutti quanti  
Che c'ho l'anima nel fondo del Po  
Bacco perbacco  
Ecco cos'e' vivere  
Bacco perbacco  
Dimmi dov'e' venere  
Baby, don't cry  
Make it funky  
Pane e vino io ti portero'

Pane e vino portero' per te  
Miele e venere x tutti quanti  
Che c'ho l'anima nel fondo del Po  
Che c'ho l'anima nel fondo del Po  



How the fuck are we supposed to know  
When I'm a monster, the way  
You refuse to die?  
How the fuck are we supposed to know  
If we're in love or if in we're pain  
  
I'm a tightrope walker  
Can't find my circus  
And I'm damaged beyond repair  
Now you're just a coffin of a girl I knew  
And I'm buried in you  
  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
Or "so"  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
No  
  
Sometimes I dream I'm an exterminating angel  
A traveling executioner from heaven  
Sent to give you the prettiest death I know  
Call the grave and make our reservations  
  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
No,  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
No,  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
You never said "I'll end up like this"  
No  
  
Are we in love or are we in pain? [Repeat: x5]  
  
How the fuck are we supposed to know  
When I'm a monster, the way  
You refuse to die?  
How the fuck are we supposed to know  
If we're in love or if in we're pain  
Why is my wound a front door to you?  
Am I my own shadow?  
Why is my wound a front door to you?  
Am I my own shadow?



I love to sing and I love to pray  
Worship the Lord most every day  
I go to the temple and I just want to stay  
To hide from the hustle of the world and its ways  
And I'd love to live on a mountain top  
Fellowshipping with the Lord  
I'd love to stand on a mountain top  
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar  
But I've got to come down from that mountain top  
To the people in the valley below  
Or they'll never know that they can go  
To the mountain of the Lord  
Now praising the Father is a good thing to do  
To worship the trinity in spirit and truth  
But if we worshiped all of the time  
There would be no one to lead the blind  
But I'd love to live on a mountain top  
Fellowshipping with the Lord  
I'd love to stand on a mountain top  
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar  
But I've got to come down from that mountain top  
To the people in the valley below  
Or they'll never know that they can go  
To the mountain of the Lord  
Now I am not saying that worship is wrong  
But worship is more than just singin' a song  
It's all that you say and everything that you do  
It's letting his spirit live through you  
Still I'd love to live on a mountain top  
Fellowshipping with the Lord  
I'd love to stand on a mountain top  
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar  
But I've got to come down from that mountain top  
To the people in the valley below  
Or they'll never know that they can go  
To the mountain of the Lord  



I think I'll take my foolish heart, my friend, and head right for the door.  
There'll be a better world waitin' if I do.  
'Cause I know I've been down this road a time or two before,  
The only time I let my heart turn to you.  
  
Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
Still somethin' deep inside keeps tellin' me to make the sacrifice,  
And askin' me to walk the extra mile.  
I've walked it now to many times with freedom for the price.  
Too many times to fight back tears behind my smiles.  
  
Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
I know I must seem quite unkind to wander off tonight  
And leave the moon up above to hold your gaze.  
It's only that my foolish heart is bound with foolish pride.  
Maybe some day I'll see the sunshine upon your face.  
  
Now I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door



(Ian hunter)  
  
Well the times gettin' hard for you little girl  
I'm a hummin' and a strummin' all over god's world  
You don't remember when you got your last meal  
And you forgot just how a woman feels  
You didn't know what rock n' roll was  
Until you met a drummer on a greyhound bus  
I got there in the nick of time  
Before he got his hands across your state line  
  
Well in the middle of the night  
On the open road  
And the heater don't work and it's oh-so cold  
You're gettin' tired baby, you're lookin' kinda beat  
The music of the street, drive you off your feet  
You didn't know how rock n' roll looked  
Until you caught your sister with a guy from the group  
Half-way home in the parking lot  
By the look in her eyes she was givin' what she got  
  
Once bitten twice shy, babe  
  
Woman you're a mess gonna die in your sleep  
All the blood on my hand and my les paul heat  
I can't leave you home cos you're runnin' around  
My best friend told me you're the best trick in town  
  
You didn't know that rock n' roll burned  
So you bought a candle and you loved and you learned  
You got the rhythm, you got the speed  
Mamma's little baby likes it short and sweet  
  
Once bitten twice shy, babe  
  
I didn't know ya got a rock n' roll record  
Until a saw your picture on another guy's jacket  
You told me I was the only one  
And look at you now, well it's dark as it's dumb  
  
Once bitten twice shy, babe



Dans mes absences parfois sans doute  
J'aurais pu m'? Loigner  
Comme si j'avais perdu ma route  
Comme si j'avais chang?  
Alors j'ai quelques mots tendresse  
Juste pour le dire Je ne vous oublie pas  
Non, jamais  
Vous? Tes au creux de moi  
Dans ma vie, dans tout ce que je fais  
Mes premiers amours, mes premiers are? Ves  
Sont venus avec vous  
C'est notre histoire? Nous  
Je ne vous oublie pas  
Non, jamais  
Vous savez tant de moi  
De ma vie, de tout ce que j'en fais  
Alors mes bonheurs, mes d? Chirures  
Se partagent avec vous  
C'est notre histoire? Nous  
Je ne vous oublie pas  
  
Parce que le temps peut mettre en cage  
Nos are? Ves et nos envies  
Je fais mes choix et mes voyages  
Parfois j'en paie le prix  
La vie me sourit ou me blesse  
Mais quelle que soit ma vie  
  
Je ne vous oublie pas  
Non, jamais  
Vous? Tes au creux de moi  
Dans ma vie, dans tout ce que je fais  
Mes premiers amours, mes premiers are? Ves  
Sont venus avec vous  
C'est notre histoire? Nous  
Je ne vous oublie pas  
  
M? Me? L'autre bout de la terre  
Je continue mon histoire avec vous  
  
Je ne vous oublie pas  
Non, jamais  
Vous? Tes au creux de moi  
Dans ma vie, dans tout ce que je fais  
Mes premiers amours, mes premiers are? Ves  
Sont venus avec vous  
C'est notre histoire? Nous  
Je ne vous oublie pas  
Non, jamais  
Vous savez tant de moi  
De ma vie, de tout ce que j'en fais  
Alors mes bonheurs, mes d? Chirures  
Se partagent avec vous  
C'est notre histoire? Nous  
Je ne vous oublie pas



"You've done it all  
You've broken every code  
And pulled the rebel to the floor  
You've spoilt the game  
No matter what you say  
For only metal, what a bore  
Blue eyes, blue eyes  
How can you tell so many lies?  
Come up and see me, make me smile  
I'll do what you want, running wild  
There's nothing left  
All is gone and run away  
Maybe you'll tarry for a while  
It's just a test  
A game for us to play  
Win or lose, it's hard to smile  
Resist, resist  
It's from yourself you'll have to hide  
Come up and see me to make me smile  
I'll do what you want, running wild  
There ain't no more  
You've taken everything  
From my belief in Mother Earth  
Can you ignore my faith in everything?  
'Cos I know what faith is  
And what it's worth  
Away, away  
And don't say maybe you'll try  
To come up and see me, make me smile  
I'll do what you want, just running wild"  
Repeat to fade



The High Street shops are boarded up  
An' the terrace it is fenced in  
See-through shields are walled across  
The way that you came in  
But there's no need to get excited  
  
As the lorries bring the bacon in  
'cause the housewives are all singing  
Groovy times are here again  
  
They discovered one black Saturday  
That mobs don't march they run  
So you can excuse the nervous triggerman  
Just this once for jumping the gun  
As they were picking up the dead  
Out of the broken glass  
Yes it's number one, the radio said  
Groovy times have come to pass!  
  
Groovy times groovy times groovy times  
  
The intake is on the uptake  
The acceleration's pretty grim  
I can remember his first appearance  
Now look what's happened to him  
So they put him in a dog suit  
Like from 1964  
The king of early evening TV  
Groovy times forever more  
  
Groovy times



Blinded by the magenta spotlight  
Stands a disposable commodity  
Don't a high price ticket make a star shine so bright  
A taste of immortality  
And the critics they call you the new 'boy wonder'  
And you know just how to make a young girl cry  
The more you feed them the more they hunger  
As you watch the money multiply  
  
[Chorus:]  
How does it feel to be?  
How does it feel to be?  
King... for a day  
  
You got the whole damn world spinning 'round your middle finger  
Hey! Shoot a little skeet with the president  
And your mother loves you more for every dollar you bring her  
And yor latest wife is worth every cent  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Blinded by the magenta spotlight  
Stands a manufactured fantasy  
Don't a high price ticket make a star  
Shine so bright  
And the people love you endlessly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How does it feel to be?  
How does it feel to be... King.



We heard the fireworks. Rushed out to watch the sky. Happy go lucky. Fourth of
July.  
How can you live in the Northeast? How can you live in the South? How can you
build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth? How
can you be a Christian? How can you be a Jew? How can you be a Muslim, a
Buddhist, a Hindu?  
How can you?  
Weak as the winter sun, we enter life on earth. Names and religion come just
after date of birth. Then everybody gets a tongue to speak, and everyone hears
an inner voice. A day at the end of the week to wonder and rejoice.  
If the answer is infinite light, why do we sleep in the dark?  
How can you live in the Northeast? How can live in the South? How can you
build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth? How
can you tattoo your body? Why do you cover your head? How can you eat from a
rice bowl, the holy man only breaks bread?  
We watched the fireworks, 'til they were fireflies. Followed a path of stars,
over the endless skies.  
How can you live in the Northeast? How can you live in the South? How can you
build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth?  
I've been given all I wanted. Only three generations off the boat. I have
harvested and I've planted. I am wearing my father's old coat.



Oh I walked through the party in the disco ljght  
Saturday is calling, and I'm feeling alright  
And I get, tired of, being alone  
She has my heart, but she has no home  
And I tried and tried tried it again  
Buy her a drink, want to be her man  
Hey oh, oh high and low  
Oh my baby, come lets go  
  
Oh Ju, Juliet, ail the things you do,  
They drive me mad  
Ju, ju, ju, ju, Juliet  
Baby I can't get you out of my head  
  
I love the nightlife, the crazy nightlife  
In the disco light baby  
I love the nightlife, the crazy nightlife  
Oh keep oh dancing, lady  
  
And we walked to my house it was late at night  
Sunday was calling, see the morning light  
And I get tired of to being with this girl  
She's so complicated, doesn't fit in my world  
And I try and try to send her home  
Called her a taxi, want to be alone  
Hey yo, oh high and low  
Oh my baby, oh please go  
  
Oh Ju, Juliet, all the things you do,  
They drive me mad  
Ju, ju, ju, ju, Juliet  
Baby how I get you out of my bed



A pistol shot at five o'clock  
The bells of heaven ring  
Tell me what you done it for  
No I won't tell you a thing  
Yesterday I begged you  
Before I hit the ground  
All I leave behind me  
Is only what I found  
If you can abide it  
Let the hurdy gurdy play  
Stranger ones have come by here  
Before they flew away  
I will not condemn you  
Nor yet would I deny  
I would ask the same of you  
But failing, will not die  
Take up your china doll  
It's only fractured  
And a little nervous from the fall  
La la la la la la la  



And I never really sleep anymore  
And I always get those dangerous dreams  
And I never get a minute of peace  
And I gotta wonder what it means  
And I gotta wonder what it means  
Maybe it's nothing and I'm under the weather  
Maybe it's just one of those bugs going round  
Maybe I'm under a spell and it's magic  
Maybe there's a witch doctor with an office in town  
  
Is this a blessing? Or is it a curse?  
Does it get any better? Can it get any worse?  
Will it go on forever? Is it over tonight?  
Does it come with the darkness? Does it bring out the light?  
Is it richer than diamonds?  
Or just a little cheaper than spit?  
  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
  
And there used to be such an easy way of living  
And there used to be every hope in the world  
And I used to get everything that I went after  
But there never used to be this girl  
No there never used to be this girl  
  
Maybe I'm crazy and I'm losing my senses  
Maybe I'm possessed by a spirit or such  
Maybe I'm desperate and I got no defenses  
Can you get me a prescription for that one perfect touch?  
  
Is this a blessing? Or is it a curse?  
Does it get any better? Can it get any worse?  
Will it go on forever? Is it over tonight?  
Does it come with the darkness? Does it bring out the light?  
Is it richer than diamonds?  
Or just a little cheaper than spit?  
  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
  
There was a time when nothing ever really mattered  
There was a time when there was nothing I didn't know  
There was a time when I knew just what I was living for  
There was a time and the time was so long ago  
There was a time and the time was so long ago  
And I never really sleep anymore

I like the way you sound in the morning,  
We're on the phone and without a warning  
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard  
  
I like the way I can't keep my focus,  
I watch you talk you didn't notice  
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together  
  
Every time you smile, I smile  
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you  
  
Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby  
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me  
  
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,  
Say that you wanna be with me too  
Cuz I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall  
  
Well I like the way your hair falls in your face  
You got the keys to me I love each freckle on your face, oh,  
I've never been so wrapped up,  
Honey, I like the way you're everything I've ever wanted  
  
I had time to think it all over and all I can say is come closer,  
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me  
  
Every time you smile, I smile  
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you  
  
Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby  
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me  
  
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,  
Say that you wanna be with me too  
I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall  
  
The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet  
I'll catch you, I'll catch you  
When people say things that bring you to your knees,  
I'll catch you  
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry  
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile  
  
Whoa oh I need you baby  
Don't be afraid please  
Jump then fall, jump then fall into me  
  
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,  
Say that you wanna be with me too  
I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall  
  
Jump then fall baby  
Jump then fall into me, into me  
  
Every time you smile, I smile  
And every time you shine, I'll shine  
And every time you're here baby, I'll show you, I'll show you  
You can jump then fall, jump then fall, jump then fall into me, into me  
  
Yeah

Gotta believe in me  
Believe me like a fairytale

And know I won't I won't  
Ever ever let you down (no)  
Like a seesaw let you down (oh)  
You know why  
'Cause we ain't in the playground no more baby  
  
We're big enough  
To stand in the picture  
We're big enough  
To stand next to love

When I was little  
But now I'm bigger

A heart-breaker  
When I was little

'Cause we're bigger,  
And love's bigger,  
I'm bigger and you're bigger  
  
Whoa oh  
Remember when my heart was young  
You were still bigger than me  
Is that the reason that you stayed  
Most would've got rid of me  
Now the bully's in the school yard  
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us  
Because we ain't pushovers no more baby  
  
We're big enough  
To stand in the picture  
We're big enough  
To stand next to love  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger

(Don't like Edle Lane?) Like yesterday  
(They shine on me) We were little then  
(In class I dreamed about you) My baby  
You wow wow (You wow wow)  
Since then all I can remember is the love only got bigger  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger

Well our hearts beat like thunder  
I don't know why they don't explode  
You got your hands in my back pockets  
And Sam Cooke's singin' on the radio  
You say that I'm the boy who can make it all come true  
Well I'm tellin' ya that I don't know if I know what to do  
  
You say that's all right, hold tight  
Well I don't even know if I'm doin' this right  
Well all right, hold tight  
We can stay out all day or we can run around all night  
Well all night, all night  
Well it's time to go home  
And I ain't even done with the night  
  
Well I don't know no good come-ons  
And I don't know no cool lines  
I feel the heat of your frustration  
I know it's burnin you up deep down inside  
You say that I'm the boy who can make it all come true  
Well I'm tellin ya that I don't know if I know what to do  
  
You say that's all right, hold tight  
Well I don't even know if I'm doin' this right  
Well all right, hold tight  
We can stay out all day or we can run around all night  
Well all night, all night  
Well it's time to go home  
And I ain't even done with the night

Her innocence inspire thoughts of sin an'  
Crazy right, she got a flower so long and smilin'  
Her shakin' makin Jamaica seem like temptation island

Feeling like the moment of truth  
Making my conscious loving and move

The family life it was divine  
She sat alone with tired eyes  
patiently listening to the sighs  
  
I found out  
I found out  
She never has the time  
I found out  
to make his demons  
  
They snatched her willingly she left  
They wondered why she'd accepted that  
She knew that she'd be saved but how  
She knew that future kid was on the prowl  
  
I found out  
I found out  
We could both run wild  
I found out  
me and future's child  
  
I found out  
I found out  
We could both run wild  
I found out  
Me and future's child  
I found out  
Never's far too long  
for me to sing this song



May minamahal  
Bawat taong may damdamin  
May minamahal  
Tulad mo at tulad ko  
Nakadama sa isa't isa ng  
Pag-ibig  
At ngayo'y nagmamahalan  
Ng tapat  
  
'Pag nagmamahal  
Bawat sandaling kasiping  
Ka'y anong bilis  
Bawat oras ay mayro'ng  
Kasaysayang anong sarap  
Anong tamis  
Maligaya nga ang taong  
Nagmamahal  
  
Coda:  
  
Kaya ako'y napaligaya  
Ng tunay na pagmamahal  
Ang lahat ng katangian ay  
Sa'yo  
Ningning ng mata, lambot  
Ng labi  
At ugaling walang  
Kapintasan  
Nababalot ng alindog,  
Katawang tunay  
  
'Pag minamahal  
Kulay rosas ang paligid ko  
Sa tuwi-tuwina nakayakap  
Sa ulap  
Buong mundo'y nagagalak  
Na mayroong nagtatalik na  
Dal'wang  
Pusong nagmamahal  
  
Kaya't tayo'y magpasalamat  
Sa ating kapalaran  
Nasa ating kapalaran  
Nasa atin ang kaganapang  
Hinahanap  
Ng bawat nilalang na may  
Puso rin  
Dahil tayo'y hindi  
Magbabago  
Hanggang may buhay.



Well the new sheriff sent me a letter  
Yes the new sheriff sent me a letter  
He said, "Come up and see me dead or alive,  
Come up and see me dead or alive".  
  
Well it's a hard road dead or alive

Well I really don't like your hard rock hotel (yeah) sheriff  
Well I really don't like your hard rock hotel, sheriff  
Dead or alive, no sheriff  
Dead or alive, no sheriff  
  
Well it's a hard road dead or alive  
And it's a hard road dead or alive  
And it's a hard road dead or alive

She says there's ants in the carpet  
Dirty little monsters  
Eating all the morsels  
Picking up the rubbish  
Give her effervescence  
She needs a little sparkle  
Good morning TV  
You're looking so healthy  
  
[Chorus]  
We all say  
Don't want to be alone  
We wear the same clothes  
Cause we feel the same  
We kiss with dry lips  
When we say goodnight  
End of a century, oh, it's nothing special  
  
Sex on the TV  
Everybody's at it  
The mind gets dirty  
As you get closer to thirty  
He gives her a cuddle  
They're glowing in a huddle  
Good night TV  
You're all made up  
And you're looking like me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can you eat her yes you can  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Oh, end of a century, oh, it's nothing special



I know just what you're thinking  
I know just how you feel  
Something sometimes inside you  
Say can't believe it's real  
So you're gonna play the game  
All the faces and the names  
And you know you're never gonna change  
  
Fool for the night  
And you don't believe it  
Fool for the night  
And you just can't see it  
  
Running through the shadows  
Like a phantom in the night  
And as the curtain raises  
You get ready for the fight  
Say you want to even up the score  
Don't know what you're doing it for  
Too much but you still need more  
  
Fool for the night  
And you don't believe it  
Fool for the night  
And you just can't see it  
  
I ain't gonna try and tell ya  
You know the story oh so well  
Everybody's out to buy and sell ya  
You're gonna wind up by yourself  
Oh here it comes again  
No it's never gonna end  
I must be dreaming  
  
Fool for the night  
Fool for the night  
Oh here it comes again  
I ain't gonna try and tell ya  
You know the story oh so well  
Everybody's out to buy and sell ya  
You're gonna wind up by yourself  
Oh here it comes again  
And I know it's never gonna end  
I must be dreaming  
  
You love the night life  
All the neon and the noise  
And underneath the spotlight  
You keep rocking with the boys  
So you're gonna get it while you can  
But you're never gonna understand  
Nobody really gives a damn  
Fool for the night and you don't believe it  
Fool for the night why don't you see it



I don't have to beg you to hold me  
Cause somebody else will  
You don't have to love me when I want it, no  
Cause somebody else will  
  
Your so called friends say you don't need it  
When all the time they're trying to get it  
Look out  
Your good thing is about to come to an end  
Your real good thing is about to come to an end  
  
All those nights I watched the four walls  
I did not have to watch them all alone  
When other men said they wanted me (whenever someone said)  
I didn't have to tell them I was your very own (think that I was)  
  
You have all the love that I've got baby  
Even ice melts to water and gets hot  
Look out  
Your good  
  
Gettin' myself back together  
Is going to be a big problem I know  
But when the right man says he wants me  
You can bet I won't tell him no  
  
Cause your real good



I drew the smile upon my face  
I paved the road that would one day leave me lonely  
No angels too good to fall from grace  
If she lets go of whatever keeps her holy  
  
But I'm still here holding on too tight, to everything that I left behind  
I don't care if the world is mine  
'Cause this is all I know  
  
When I got my back up against the wall  
Don't need no one to rescue me  
'Cause I ain't waiting up for no miracle  
Yeah, tonight I'm running free  
Into the blue, into the blue  
With nothing to lose, into the blue  
  
I'm not ashamed of all my mistakes  
'Cause through the cold  
I still kept the fire burning  
These memories that I can't erase  
Always remind me I'm on an endless journey  
  
But I'm still here holding on too tight  
To everything that I left behind  
I don't care if the world is mine  
'Cause this is all I know  
  
When I got my back up against the wall  
Don't need no one to rescue me  
'Cause I ain't waiting up for no miracle  
Yeah, tonight I'm running free  
Into the blue, into the blue  
With nothing to lose  
Into the blue  
  
I'll go where nobody knows  
Wherever the wind is blowing  
Even if I'm alone  
  
When I got my back up against the wall  
Don't need no one to rescue me  
'Cause I ain't waiting up for no miracle  
Yeah tonight I'm running free  
Into the blue, into the blue  
With nothing to lose  
Into the blue



She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
She doesn't care just as long as his ship's coming in  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
They laugh they make money  
  
He's got a gold watch  
  
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts  
  
that bounce on his Italian leather sofa.  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's a good man  
  
She doesn't care just as long as she still has her friends  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
they laugh, they make money  
  
He's got a gold watch  
  
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts  
  
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa  
  
She's got a serrated edge  
  
that she moves back and forth  
  
It's such a simple machine she doesn't have to use force  
  
When she gets what she wants,  
  
she puts the rest on a tray in a ziplock bag  
  
[REPEAT]  
  
...in the freezer  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
She doesn't care just as long as his ship's coming in  
  
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island  
  
They laugh, they make money  
  
He's got a gold watch  
  
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts  
  
that bounce on his Italian leather sofa



It was a hundred and seven  
We were heading to town  
She had her sleeves rolled up  
And the windows rolled down  
That girl is a cowboy  
Robert Earl was singing out  
The "Buckin' Song"  
With every word that Keen was bringing  
She was singing along  
That girl is a cowboy  
  
(chorus)  
Sometimes the best cowboys  
Ain't cowboys at all  
She's got my back  
Even when it's against the wall  
When I need a friend  
She's the guy I call  
'Cause sometimes the best cowboys  
Ain't cowboys at all  
  
So I took her out to show her  
How to rope and ride  
I can't believe that it was me  
That wound up broke and tied  
That girl is a cowboy  
  
So that night I decided  
We should paint the town  
I made it home although  
I really don't remember how  
That girl is a cowboy  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
There's just something that a cowgirl has  
Ain't no cowboys got  
Man she's something when she's one of the boys  
But something else  
Any time she's not  
  
(Repeat Chorus)



Well, I wait around the train station  
Waitin' for that train  
Waitin' for the train, yeah  
Take me home, yeah  
From this lonesome place  
Well, now a while lotta people put me down a lotta changes  
My girl had called me a disgrace  
  
Dig  
The tears burnin'  
Tears burnin' me  
Tears burnin' me  
Way down in my heart  
Well, you know it's too bad, little girl,  
It's too bad  
Too bad we have to part (have to part)  
  
Dig  
Gonna leave this town, yeah  
Gonna leave this town  
Gonna make a whole lotta money  
Gonna be big, yeah  
Gonna be big, yeah  
I'm gonna buy this town  
I'm gonna buy this town  
An' put it all in my shoe  
Might even give a piece to you  
That's what I'm gonna do,  
What I'm gonna do,  
What I'm gonna do



All devils eve the witches exchange energy  
Black warlocks concentrate predicting prophecies  
Announcing serenade uniting under stars  
The celebration desecration from afar  
Secret - evening - thunder  
Pagans - dancing - under  
Pale moon - rising - watching  
Starlight - gazes - catching  
All devils eve  
All devils eve  
All devils eve the candle red alights the Queen  
The black familiars in pentacles of green  
Flowing the bloodline past millennia so strong  
Reciting atmospheres to tangle mortal song  
Secret - evening - thunder  
Pagans - dancing - under  
Pale moon - rising - watching  
Starlight - gazes - catching  
All devils eve  
All devils eve  
All devils eve electric orgy spells are cast  
Magnetic impulses circles painted last  
The psychic inspiration rings the pewter bell  
The bond exists in consciousness invisible  
Secret - evening - thunder  
Pagans - dancing - under  
Pale moon - rising - watching  
Starlight - gazes - catching  
All devils eve  



Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
  
You better listen well  
When i tell you  
To be on the look out  
You can't call for help  
  
'Cause i know you inside out  
Despite all your hideouts  
I'm no great pretender  
I'll make you surrender  
  
So come along quietly  
Here's a thought to remember  
I have not met a man yet  
To escape from my drag-net  
  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
  
I'll give you just the facts man  
And you can draw all your own conclusions  
I'll keep your mind surrounded  
With chains of love so strong  
  
You can't break through them  
My arsenal is stocked  
With all kinds of seductive weapons  
Although your heart's locked up  
  
My love will assist me  
So that you can't resist me  
  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me

Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me  
Give up, give up  
Give up you're love to me



Dear heart  
I wish you could see that  
Dear heart  
You mean the world to me  
  
Man with the broken heart filled with lead  
Suffered and he fought for what he believed  
The fighting is over now, the man is dead  
A martyr for the cause  
  
Man with the golden arm, his face gone pale  
Taken too much junk, he's gone over the rail  
Breathes out a sigh and his body wails  
He's gonna land in trouble, land in jail  
  
He'd give his life, give his everything  
To reach that goal and take that last and final fling  
But I guess it's just another story  
In the greatest story ever told  
  
Dear heart  
I wish that you could see that  
Dear heart  
You mean the world to me



My intentions are good, my hearts in the right place now  
You see I wanna be good to you, baby but sometimes I just don't know how  
And the hand of fate, reaches out once more  
And pulls me though that gate, like one hundred times before  
Ooh, there are the nights, when things just work out right  
No one could be as close as you and me  
Then it all breaks down and we can't find that common ground  
That's not the way, the way it oughta be, baby, oh, oh  
Why do we laugh, why do we cry? Why do we feel this pain inside?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
In this game of hit and miss, how long can we go on like this?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
But if we threw it all away, it's something we'd regret someday  
Oh, heaven knows  
Why do we do these foolish things?  
Only heaven knows  
My intentions are good, my actions are hard to explain  
I get misunderstood sometimes, there's nobody but me to blame  
I've gotta speak my mind and deal with the situation  
Open the lines, the lines of communication  
Ooh there are the nights, we really get it right  
Makin' love, endlessly  
And then there are the days, we go our separate ways  
As though there's nothin' left of you and me, baby, oh no  
Nothin' left of you and me  
Why do we laugh, why do we cry? Why do we feel this pain inside?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
In this game of hit and miss, how long can we go on like this?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
But if we threw it all away, it's something we'd regret someday  
Oh, heaven knows  
Why do we laugh, why do we cry?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
Why do we feel this pain inside?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
But if we threw it all away, it's something we'd regret someday, oh  
Why do we do these foolish things?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
You see, I wanna be good to you, baby  
Heaven knows  
Why do we feel this pain inside?  
You see I wanna be good to you, baby  
Heaven knows, oh yeah  
Heaven knows, heaven knows  



I close my eyes and picture the emerald of the sea  
From the fishing boats at Dingle to the shores of Dunardee  
I miss the river Shannon and the folks at Skibbereen  
The moorlands and the midlands with their forty shades of green  
  
But most of all I miss a girl in Tipperary town  
And most of all I miss her lips as soft as eiderdown  
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen  
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar and there's forty shades of green  
  
(Green green green forty shades of green)  
I wish that I could spend an hour at Dublin's churching surf  
I'd love to watch the farmers drain the bogs and spade the turf  
To see again the thatching of the straw the women glean  
  
I'd walk from Cork to Larne to see the forty shades of green  
But most of all I miss a girl...



This isn't goodbye  
Even as I watch you leave  
This isn't goodbye  
I swear I won't cry  
Even as tears fill my eyes  
I swear I won't cry  
  
Any other girl I let you walk away  
Any other girl I'm sure I'll be okay  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me what makes a man want to give you all his heart  
Smile when you're around and cry when you're apart  
If you know what makes a man want to love you the way I do  
Girl you gotta let me know so I can get over you  
  
What makes us so right  
Is it the sound of the laugh  
That look in her eyes  
When do you decide  
She is the dream that you see  
That falls in your life  
  
And you'll apologize no matter who was wrong  
You'll get on your knees if that would bring her home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Other girls that come along they always knew  
What's the point when all I ever want is you  
Tell me  
  
[Chorus]



I survived, everything  
I have tried, everything (everything, everything)  
  
All the walls begin to devolve away  
Do your hands begin to shake shake shake shake shake?  
And just who do you think you used to be?  
All beings to burn to break to break to break  
  
Wave goodbye, wish me well  
I've become, something else (something else, something else, just as well)  
  
But this thing that lives inside of me  
Will surely rise awake awake awake awake awake  
And the sead that brekas right through to me  
And it comes to grab and take and take and take and take  
  
I am home, I believe  
I am home, I am free  
I am home, I can see  
Always here, finally  
  
I am home, I believe  
I am home, I am free



Hmm, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
You don't have to tell me you've gone to found someone new  
'Cause I can feel his presence, whenever I'm a kissing you  
How can you ask me to try, try and understand  
Well, just put yourself in my place  
Go on, just see if you can  
  
I'm a begging you (Don't, don't you let him)  
Baby, please (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)  
I'm begging you, baby (Don't, don't you let him)  
Oh no (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)  
  
So what if he whispers how much he loves you in your ear  
But pay no mind 'cause I love you much more my dear, huh  
My love are like mountains  
That's how strong it is for you  
If you ever walk away in to his arms  
Which will surely break my heart in two  
  
I'm begging you (Don't, don't you let him)  
Oh no (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)  
Baby, baby, I'm begging (Don't, don't you let him)  
No, no, no, no (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)  
Oh, I couldn't stand it, baby  
  
If you leave me for him you would truly be unfair  
Now, just ask yourself, whenever you needed me, wasn't I always there  
Now, I'm begging you, baby, baby, down on my bended knees  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, please stay here with me  
  
Baby, please (Don't, don't you let him)  
Oh no (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)  
Baby, baby, please (Don't, don't you let him)  
I couldn't stand it (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)  
I ain't too proud to beg (Don't, don't you let him)



You told me about yourself,  
How you once lived with someone else  
The way of life that you had tried  
The way they hurt you deep inside  
That's the only thing about it  
I can't find anyone to doubt it  
That's the only thing about it  
I can't find anyone to doubt it  
Who do you think you're talking to?  
When I look at you I know you're lying  
All you say and do  
Seems to fall apart and leave you crying  
  
But I thought I could've seen you here today  
But you leave me standing each and every way  
You told me a pack of lies  
That I can't even reason with  
Failure of your moral code  
The kind of things that I can't give  
That's the only thing about it  
I can't find anyone to doubt it  
That's the only thing about it  
I can't find anyone to doubt it  
Who do you think you're talking to?  
When I look at you I know you're lying  
All you say and do  
Seems to fall apart and leave you crying  
  
Who do you think you're talking to?  
When I look at you I know you're lying  
All you say and do  
Seems to fall apart and leave you crying



Shock the monkey to life  
Shock the monkey to life  
  
Cover me when I run  
Cover me through the fire  
Something knocked me out' the trees  
Now I'm on my knees  
Cover me, darling please  
Monkey, monkey, monkey  
Don't you know when you're going to shock the monkey  
  
Fox the fox  
Rat the rat  
You can ape the ape  
I know about that  
There is one thing you must be sure of  
I can't take any more  
Darling, don't you monkey with the monkey  
Monkey, monkey, monkey  
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey  
  
Wheels keep turning  
Something's burning  
Don't like it but I guess I'm learning  
  
Shock! - watch the monkey get hurt, monkey  
  
Cover me, when I sleep  
Cover me, when I breathe  
You throw your pearls before the swine  
Make the monkey blind  
Cover me, darling please  
Monkey, monkey, monkey  
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey  
  
Too much at stake  
Ground beneath me shake  
And the news is breaking  
  
Shock! - watch the monkey get hurt, monkey  
  
Shock the monkey  
Shock the monkey  
Shock the monkey to life



She's got pizazz  
Like a razzmatazz  
I'd like to slide it in  
But where do I begin  
  
Wastes all my money  
Spends all my time  
I ain't got no luck  
Can't change her mind  
  
Blame it on you  
I can't stand up  
Blame it on you  
I'm keepin' my mouth shut  
Blame it on you  
I can't see straight  
Blame it on you  
Uh-oh, too late  
  
I want a little reaction  
How 'bout a kiss or two?  
She said, "Jump back honey,"  
I said, "no can do."  
  
Why do you always make a fool out of me?  
I can't get no nookie  
Just plain to see  
  
Wastes all my money  
Spends all my time  
I ain't got no luck  
Can't change her mind  
  
Blame it on you  
I can't get no sleep  
Blame it on you  
I'm in six feet deep  
Blame it on you  
Well I guess it's true  
Blame it on you  
Yes, I do  
  
I blame this whole damn mess, honey  
Right on you  
  
Now listen little girl, let me explain  
Why you got me in such a terrible way  
She's got pizazz  
Like a razzmatazz  
I'd like to slide it in  
But where do I begin  
  
Blame it on you  
I can't get no sleep  
Blame it on you  
I'm in six feet deep  
Blame it on you  
Well I guess it's true  
Blame it on you  
Yes, I do



She had a dream  
And boy it was a good one  
So she chased after her dream  
With much desire  
But when she got too close  
To her expectations  
Well the dream burned up  
Like paper in fire  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin' up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Smokin' up the alleyways  
Who's to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire?  
  
He wanted love  
With no involvement  
So he chased the wind  
That's all his silly life required  
And the days of vanity  
Went on forever  
And he saw his days burn up  
Like paper in fire  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin' up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Smokin' up the alleyways  
Who's to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire?  
  
There's a good life  
Right across this green field  
And each generation  
Stares at it from afar  
But we keep no check  
On our appetites  
So the green fields turn to brown  
Like paper in fire  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin' up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Blowin' down the alleyways  
Who's to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire?  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin' up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Blowin' down the alleyways  
Who's to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire?



[Intro:]  
Who wanna bet us that they can't fuck wit us?  
Stack cheddar forever, live treacherous, solely etceteras  
Til the death of us, me and my confidents  
We shine, we make the ambiance, you niggas just rhyme  
  
You lil niggas need guidance, you barkin up the wrong trees  
Pissin on the wrong hydrants, I'm a high fence  
I grew up round violence, you grew up playin violins  
In yo hood silence, where I'm from silence  
  
[Verse:]  
They just killed this vibe, they just killed this vibe  
There's something bout killing shit that makes us feel alive  
We feed off yo energy, we see you on that Kenny G  
Just do in yo own harm, do yo thing my nig  
Whenever you will not keep to that mighty nyc  
We gon check that name you claim  
Bring yo job and id  
We take it the wrong way, all gold everything  
One gold watch, two gold chains, give me all those, everything  
Yall don't wanna pump heads, ocho, Evelyn  
Them boys will leave you butt naked  
And the mall closed and everything  
The streets is watchin aksin if you gon reply to them  
Seem like yall woke up sleeping giants, Eli and Em  
  
[Hook:]  
A major comeback but from a minor setback  
But still they know we livin, was thinkin bout to get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
I crack a smile knowing God has a day for me  
Until that day comes I slay these niggas faithfully  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
  
[Verse:]  
I'm like Nino with the uzzi back of the motorcycle head  
Until you're back at them Italians who killed Keisha at the wedding  
I'm like dope boy lookin for Ricky's killer  
One last soldier, niggas who turn they backs on me  
Turn yo punk ass over  
Yall smoke my smoked my cousin Harold  
Now I'm in a Camaro  
Love and happiness playing, me and my dog with a double barrel  
38, 40 belows, live or die motherfucker  
I'm Pac, ride or miss, riverside motherfucker  
Get back, everybody better get back  
To my niggas in the jet black  
For the seats let back on yo jet back  
If you're a gambling man you could bet that  
It's a sure thing, not just a New York thing  
A rich or a poor thing  
It's a lace yo boots, pull yo draw string, who wanna go to war thing?  
It's a who gon protect your thing?  
Who really wanted morphine?  
Put legends in coffins  
It's a bullet holes in the door thing  
It's a nobody, sure things  
Street cold, not a Lord thing  
It's kids that wasn't taught things, old ladies like poor thing  
Poor thing, to get back is important  
Poor thing, for the dead homies we pour pain  
Like what you sayin while it's cocked back to em  
Guess what goes around comes around, got back to em  
  
[Hook:]  
A major comeback but from a minor setback  
But still they know we livin, was thinkin bout to get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
I crack a smile knowing God has a day for me  
Until that day comes I slay these niggas faithfully  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back



Accept me for who I am  
That I'm only human  
And there are more important things  
Then what we fight about  
We won't always see eye to eye  
We say hurtful things, sometimes  
And it gets hard when you love someone so much  
  
Everybody's got highs, and lows  
It's alright  
Its the weight of love  
Highs and lows, it's alright  
Oh, It's the weight of love  
  
Remember our first kiss  
And how we melted in our seats  
There will never be a January  
As warm in Tennessee  
It was an angel in the night  
Nothing's ever felt so right  
And even the stars over our backyard  
Don't shine sometimes  
  
Everybody's got highs, and lows  
It's alright  
Its the weight of love  
Highs and lows, it's alright  
Oh, It's the weight of love  
  
We will grow old together  
Even for worse or better  
Nothing will ever keep us apart  
  
Everybody's got highs, and lows  
It's alright  
Its the weight of love  
Highs and lows, it's alright  
Oh, It's the weight of love



[Intro]  
Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
I've had it stuck in my head all day long  
I wrote it in the car on my ride home  
Cause I knew I'd walk in the door and I'd be alone  
Why'd I even put up that fuckin' tree?  
If there's no one here that's gonna see  
Just how pretty she looks on Christmas Eve  
Cause there's no one here next to me  
  
[Chorus 1]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I light another bong  
I turn on the radio  
I binge watch our favorite shows  
This year feels kind of lame  
But the last one was the same  
But the holiday spirit they say  
Is taking off on a plane  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
  
[Verse 2]  
I always thought that Santa was kind of cute  
There's something about his beard, big belly, and boots  
I left Santa more than cookies this year  
I thought he might appreciate a few beers  
That's why I'm always on the naughty list  
He said cause when I get drunk, I'm always showing my tits  
He leaned in for a kiss and he got real near  
I had to stop Santa and say "My true love ain't here"  
  
[Chorus 2]  
This is my sad Christmas song  
So I rip another bong  
I never been good at making plans  
Next year, I'm gonna be with my man  
My little sister says I'm the Grinch  
But my mom thinks I'm just a bitch  
Why did you have to go?  
We were under the mistletoe  
This is my sad Christmas song  
Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala  
  
[Bridge]  
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas, why did you have to go?  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas, know I miss you so  
Missing you on fuckin' Christmas, why did you have to go?  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas, know I miss you so  
  
[Outro]  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas  
(Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala)  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas  
(Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala)  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas  
(Fa lalalala  
Fa lalala)  
Wishing you a Merry Christmas



I'd walk across Kansas in a New York minute  
Climb the Colorado mountains in the fall  
Crawl through Arizona like a flatland lizard  
If I thought it'd do me any good at all  
I could swim Lake Erie with my hands tied behind me  
Eat a West Virginia coal miner's shoes  
Drink the Mississippi River if it took a month of Sundays  
Just to prove my love for you  
I remember well the first time that I kissed you  
Cause the things ain't been the same ever since  
You got me thinkin' I could eat a ten penny nail And spit out a barbed wire
fence  
Now there ain't a livin' creature gonna ever come between us  
I'd fight lions snakes and gorillas too  
And if that ain't enough  
We'll start all over just to prove my love for you  
I could ride my pony through the eye of a hurricane  
Climb Mount Everest on a string  
Jump Niagara Falls in a burnin' barrel  
And bring you back a hoop smoke ring  
Wrestle alligators in the Okefenokee  
There's nothin' I wouldn't do  
If you just say the word I'll catch  
That Great Speckled Bird and bring it back to you  
I remember well the first time  
I'd walk across Kansas in a New York minute



Can you hear me calling  
Out your name  
You know I'm falling  
And I don't know what to say  
  
I'll speak a little louder  
I'll even shout  
You know that I'm proud  
And I can't get the words out  
  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Wanna be with you everywhere  
  
Something's happening  
Happening to me  
My friends all say  
I'm acting peculiarly  
  
C'mon baby  
We better make a start  
You better do it soon  
Before you break my heart  
  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Wanna be with you everywhere  
  
Can you hear me calling  
Out your name  
You know I'm falling  
And I don't know what to say  
  
Come along baby  
We better make a start  
You better do it soon  
Before you break my heart  
  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Oh I, I want to be with you everywhere  
Wanna be with you everywhere



I'm alone, sitting with my broken glass  
My four walls follow me through my past  
I was on a Paris train  
I emerged in London rain  
And you waiting there swimming through apologies  
  
I remember searching for the perfect words  
I was hoping you might change your mind  
I remember the soldier standing next to me  
Riding on the Metro  
  
I was smiling as you took my hand  
Saw the mood we spoke in France  
You were passed as shallow word  
It isn't passed there's still a hurt  
You were passed as shallow word  
It isn't passed there's still a hurt  
I can see you now smiling as I pulled away..  
Sorry  
  
I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand  
"I'll love you always" filled my eyes  
I remember the night we walked along the Seine  
Riding on the Metro  
  
I remember a feeling coming over me  
The soldier turned, then walked away  
Fuck you for loving me  
Riding on the Metro



Yesterday's a by-line, words upon a page  
Tomorrow is a deadline, sudden and it's strange  
Hard To Believe  
You ever would leave, but you did  
Hard To Believe  
You ever would leave  
  
Nowhere to go, can't sit still  
Look for a motive in the time that I kill  
Thinking of ways  
To fill up my empty days, to fill up my empty days  
  
Hard To Believe  
you'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
  
Love is such a fine line, the finest line I've known  
But sorrow is no life line when you're all alone  
  
Hard To Believe  
You ever would leave, but you did  
Hard To Believe  
You ever would leave  
  
Can't sleep a wink, up all night  
The truth hurts, you know it cuts like a knife  
Thinking of ways  
To fill up my empty life, to fill up my empty life  
  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe



I'll be home for Christmas  
You can plan on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents on the tree  
  
Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can plan on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents on the tree  
  
Christmas Eve'll find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams



Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson  
Gonna tell the world that I've fallen for you  
I've got a secret, I can't hold it back anymore  
I've got to share it with everyone I know  
It's a lifetime waiting for someone like you  
I'm falling, a feeling too good to be true, so true  
I write you a song on the radio  
I want them to know that I'll die for you  
Chorus:  
This is the right time, oh oh this is the moment  
I'm gonna tell the world that I've fallen for you x2  
I never thought that, there was a space inside me  
But you found it, a place where you wanted to be  
I'm happy, you gave me time to see  
I'm falling, for the first time I feel that I'm free  
I write you a song on the radio  
I want them to know that I'll die for you  
Chorus  
I'll write you a poem in the magazine  
I'll buy some time in the 7 o'clock news  
I run through the city naked shout and scream  
Heeyoo heyoooooo  
I'll drop some flyers from an aeroplane  
I'm making a movie where I'm singing in the rain  
I send out the message to the outer space  
Calling earth, ground control, do you read me?  
I read you, over  
We've got a small problem up here  
We found a guy who says he's got a message for the world  
I think he's really fallen in love...over and out  
Chorus  
Ohooo heeyooooo  
Ohooo can't hold it back no more  
Ohooo heeyooooo  
Ohooo gonna tell the world  
Chorus  



The auctioneer said, I'm not through yet,  
Here's a horse the likes of which you've never seen,  
And the straw hats in the sun, with a face beneath each one,  
Shown doubtful and the auctioneer got mean.  
Do you think that you can find a horse like this every day?  
I don't think there's any better on this earth,  
And the more you pay, the more it's worth.  
  
Then out she came, a snow-white mare,  
Prancin' and a dancin' in the silver sun,  
They watched her from behind, as she did her bump and grind,  
Walkin' naked, sad and graceful for their fun.  
Oh how I wished I could afford that lady painted white,  
A queen with high nobility of birth,  
But the more you pay, the more it's worth.  
  
My pockets hung with empty blues,  
Silent heels were standin' on my growin' pains,  
My bid was not too bad, two bits was all I had,  
And the stable boy just handed me the reins.  
Well the gallery went wild, and the auctioneer half smiled,  
What we don't sell we shoot or give away,  
'Cause the more you pay, the more it's worth.  
  
And where was the boy, who rode on her back,  
With his arms holding tight round her neck?  
How tightly he clung,  
When they both were young,  
And fate had not let this poor girl be so  
Disgraced.



Bells will be ringing this sad sad New Years  
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues  
My baby's gone I have no friends  
To wish me greetings once again  
Cries will be singing Silent Night  
Christmas carols by candlelight  
Please come home for Christmas  
Please come home for Christmas  
If not for Christmas by New Years night  
Friends and relations send salutations  
Sure as the stars shine above  
But this is Christmas yes Christmas my dear  
The time of year to be with the ones you love  
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam  
Christmas and new Years will find you home  
There'll be no more sorrow no grief and pain  
And I'll be happy, happy once again  
Oh there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain  
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again



You make me nervous when you're flying around  
The secret service couldn't track you down  
You tell me no then you kiss me  
You say hello then you ditch me  
You try to run when you see me  
  
I never knew what this dream was about  
You say let's go then you're lost in the crowd  
I don't know where you're going  
You won't show then you're showing  
I don't know then I'm knowing

Imprisoned in this world of darkness few have known  
A monster lusting blood and the hunger grows  
Out on the street, danger's real, the killer's still at large  
A trail of death through sewers to the underground  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse, cast them down  
  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
I just can't go on  
In this living hell  
  
This town has worn thin everybody knows  
Panic in the news and the terror grows  
A tunnel full of filth escape into the night  
Another hole to dwell in the underground  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse, cast them down  
  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
I just can't go on  
In this living hell  
  
In this living hell  
In this living hell  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds, the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse, cast them down  
  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
Living hell, whoa  
I just can't go on  
In this living hell



Sometimes it seems the good times  
Never will return  
A lot has changed, babe  
'Cause evil rules the world  
  
You said you're looking for a place  
Where there's no hate  
Oh, babe, it really makes no sense  
To escape  
  
How long will it take  
To make the world a flaming star  
How long will it take  
'Til they stop their senseless wars  
  
How long will it take  
Til everybody will understand  
That we need to fill our hearts with love again  
  
The only future we've got  
Exists right now  
Let's take the time, babe  
As long as the world is turning 'round  
  
How long will it take  
To make the earth a fireball  
How long will it take  
  
'Til no more life exists at all  
How long will it take  
'Til everybody will understand  
That we need to fill our hearts with love again  
  
It's up to you  
To fight the evil in your mind  
It's up to you  
The more love you give, the more you'll find  
The more love you give, the more you'll find  
  
Don't make the world a flaming stra  
Stop, stop all these senseless wars  
How long will it take  
'Til everybody will understand  
That we need to fill our hearts with love again



Grandma' welcome home  
You have  
Been gone for far too long  
Is this a dream, are You really back?  
  
Let me help You out of the chair  
Grandma'  
Let me touch You, let me feel  
  
Grandma' take a look  
What do You think of the house and  
The silvery moon?  
We are going to repaint the front door  
Soon  
  
Let me help You out of the chair  
Grandma'  
Let me touch You, let me feel  
  
Wait till You see Your room up in the  
Attic  
Prepared just like You said, without a  
Bed  
You will find Your rocking chair and  
The tea pot that Missy found  
  
Let me help You out of the chair  
Grandma'  
There is someone waiting for You,  
Now come along  
  
Missy and Mother, they are dying to  
Meet You  
How strange, she's spoken no word  
I wonder Grandma!  
Are You all right?  
  
Grandma' what was it like to be on  
That holiday site  
"Oh it could have been worse but  
With "them" by my side  
In the twilight "they" sang all the old  
Lullabies"  
Grandma' who are "they"  
"Never mind You dirty little brat"  
  
"Let us go inside, something's on  
"Their" mind  
"They" are still alive, can You feel  
"Their" eyes  
Can You feel "their" eyes?  
Now that You are stuck with me You  
Better be my friend.



I love the woman, an' learned a lesson that I can't forget  
Yes, I love the woman, an' learned a lesson that I can't forget  
Yes, she's mean an' she's evil and now my life is in a solid mess  
Yeah...  
She wakes me in the mornin'  
Right before the break of day  
Tellin' me to get up and go out  
I had a earn myself some pay  
How she scolds me like an orphan  
And treats me like a clown  
And when I need some lovin'  
That woman can't be found  
And I love the woman  
And learned a lesson that I can't forget  
Yes, she's mean an' she's evil  
And now my life is in a solid mess!



Verse:  
Don't pour out all the oil  
It isn't very good for the soil  
Don't waste the only fuel that we have  
  
Chorus:  
The lawnmower needs some gasoline  
And I need some for my camero  
Don't pour it down the driveway  
Not today or tomorrow  
I really wanna take a bath  
In the brown, think sludge  
It looks pretty tasty  
It smells a lot like fudge  
  
Verse:  
My pants are all brown  
Do you see my scary frown  
That means I probably want to pound on you  
  
Chorus:  
The lawnmower needs some gasoline  
And I need some for my camero  
Don't pour it down the driveway  
Not today or tomorrow  
I really wanna take a bath  
In the brown, think sludge  
It looks pretty tasty  
It smells a lot like fudge



Let me hear the battle cry  
Calling on the wind  
Let me see the banners fly  
Before the storm begins  
  
Let me feel the spirits soar  
Destroy the enemy  
Striking at the evil core  
For all the world to see  
  
This day will last forever  
Deep in the hearts of men  
Courage and victory  
Remember, remember  
  
One shot at glory  
In the crossfire overhead  
Fate stands before me  
Words have all been said  
  
One shot at glory  
Driving hard and seeing red  
Destiny calls me  
One night of fire  
One shot at glory  
  
Fighting on with dignity  
In life and death we deal  
The power and the majesty  
Amidst the blood and steel  
  
I still hear the battle cry  
The call goes on and on  
I still see the banners fly  
The battle's always won



Got those highway blues, can't you hear my motor runnin'  
Flyin' down the road with my foot on the floor  
All the way in town they can hear me comin'  
Ford's about to drop, she won't do no more  
And i smell my motor burnin'  
Underneath the hood is smoke  
Can't stop, and i can't stop  
Got to keep on movin' or i'll lose my mind  
  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
  
The highway patrol got his eyes on me  
I know what he's thinkin' and it ain't good  
I'm movin' so fast he can barely see me  
Gonna lose that man, i know i should  
I gotta kick in my pedal  
Make my ford move a little bit faster  
Can't stop, and i can't stop  
Got to keep on movin' or i'll lose my mind  
  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway  
Oh, rockin' down the highway



Silent night  
Holy night  
All is calm  
All is bright  
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night  
Holy night  
Son of God  
Oh love's pure light  
Radiant beams from  
Thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus Lord at Thy birth  
Oh Jesus Lord at Thy birth  
  
Sleep  
Sleep  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Peace  
Sleep  
Sleep  
Sleep in heavenly peace



Lucy sells her flowers for a quarter apiece  
She wound up on the streets  
She could not pay her lease  
She used to want to save the world  
But nothing to her matters now  
She lays bout the subway station  
Clad in dirty tatters now  
  
Lucy's in the subway with daffodils  
She lost all her diamonds  
And she sold all her pills  
She's been around the block  
But she's had too many thrills  
Lucy's in the subway with daffodils  
  
Lucy holds a dixie cup  
Of sixty cents in change  
And if she looks you in the eye  
You see that she's deranged  
She flew too near the sun  
And fried her fragile wings  
But to her faithful whisky bottle she clings  
  
Lucy's in the subway with daffodils  
She lost all her diamonds  
And she sold all her pills  
She's been around the block  
But she's had too many thrills  
Lucy's in the subway with daffodils



I wish somebody would empty my head  
I am so sorry for the things that I've said  
This hopeless feeling that's living inside  
I'm just a lonely soul who's trying to find  
Some peace of mind  
  
I ain't no hero who's gonna save you  
I just say "hi" as I'm passing right through  
I ain't that crazy, I'm only here for the ride  
So please forgive me while I'm trying to find  
Some peace of mind  
  
Read in between the lines  
Truth that is neither black nor white  
Black nor white  
Just give me something real  
Broken man still searching for the light  
In the night  
  
Caught In the middle as the front line falls  
It looks like I don't stand a chance  
If only I could turn my life around  
Or is this just the circumstance



I'm strong  
But I break  
I'm stubborn  
And I make plenty of mistakes  
Yeah I'm hard  
And life with me is never easy  
To figure out, to love  
I'm jaded but oh so lovely  
All you have to do is hold me  
And you'll know and you'll see just how sweet it can be  
If you'll trust me, love me, let me  
Maybe, maybe  
  
Someday  
When we're at the same place  
When we're on the same road  
When it's OK to hold my hand  
Without feeling lost  
Without all the excuses  
When it's just because you love me, you let me, you need me  
Then maybe, maybe  
All you have to do is hold me  
And you'll know and you'll see just how sweet it can be  
If you'll trust me, love me, let me  
Maybe, maybe  
  
I'm confusing as hell  
I'm north and south  
And I'll probably never have it all figured out  
But what I know is I wasn't meant to walk this world without you  
And I promise I'll try  
Yeah I'm gonna try to give you every little part of me  
Every single detail you missed with your eyes  
Then maybe  
Maybe, yeah maybe  
Yeah maybe  
Maybe, yeah maybe, maybe  
  
One day  
We'll meet again and you'll need me, you'll see me completely  
Every little bit  
Oh yeah maybe you'll love me, you'll love me then  
  
I don't want to be tough  
And I don't want to be proud  
I don't need to be fixed and I certainly don't need to be found  
I'm not lost  
I need to be loved  
I just need to be loved  
I just want to be loved by you and I won't stop 'cause I believe  
That maybe, yeah maybe  
Maybe, yeah maybe  
Maybe, maybe  
  
I should know better than to touch the fire twice  
But I'm thinking maybe, yeah maybe you might  
  
Maybe, love maybe



Away in a manger, no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus  
Laid down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky  
Look down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing  
Poor baby awakes  
The little Lord Jesus  
No crying he makes  
I love the Lord Jesus  
Look down from the sky  
And stay by my craddle  
Till morning is nigh  
  
Be near me Lord Jesus  
I ask thee to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children  
From thy tender care  
And take us to heaven  
To live with thee there.



Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey with a monkey monkey  
La la la  
  
Oh, I count to ten  
But I don't know how  
And I don't know when  
To open my eyes  
  
Baby if you kiss me again  
Like you did just now  
Like you did just then  
Just Do it again  
  
I've had the rest  
Now it's time I had the best  
So you tell me  
That you won't do anymore  
  
Well I'd write your heart a letter  
But I think you know me better  
If I keep on asking baby, maybe  
I'll get what I'm asking for  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving in to it  
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la  
  
Oh, I hate your friends  
But I don't know how and I don't know when  
To open your eyes  
Yes, the monkey's back again  
Do you want him now like you did back then?  
  
I tried my best but your head is such a mess  
So I guess that I don't want you anymore  
Well you say you care about me  
That you just can't do without me  
But you keep on dancin' baby  
'Til that monkey has you on the floor  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la  
  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on your back  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on you  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on your back  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on you  
  
So you tell me  
That you won't do anymore  
If I keep on askin' baby, maybe  
I'll get what I'm askin' for  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la



It's you, no one else will do  
I knew one day  
Another true love would come my way  
Only time will tell  
If it's right, it just can't fail  
And there you were  
And my quest for love is over  
Now my only lover...is you  
  
No one else will do  
It's true  
I'm the only one for you  
  
Love ain't so bad  
If you have an understanding  
You know it's everlasting  
You let it show with the test of time  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine  
Without a doubt  
Now my quest for love is over  
Now my only lover  
  
It's you....i'll never love another  
Nobody can take your place  
Without a doubt  
My quest for love is over  
My only lover  
It's you



[Miley]  
Ooh  
Yeah  
I didn't wanna listen to what you were sayin'  
I thought that I knew all I need to know  
I didn't realize that somewhere inside me  
I knew you were right but I couldn't say so  
  
I can take care of myself, yeah, you taught me well  
  
[Chorus: (Miley)]  
I learned from you that I do not crumble  
I learned that strength is something you choose  
All of the reasons to keep on believin'  
There's no question, that's a lesson, that I learned from you  
  
[Billy Ray]  
We always don't agree on  
What is the best way  
To get to the place that we're going from here  
But I can really trust you, and give you the distance  
to make your decisions without any fear  
  
[Both]  
I'm grateful for all of the times  
You opened my eyes  
  
[Chorus: (Both)]  
I learned from you that I do not crumble  
I learned that strength is something you choose  
All of the reasons to keep on believin'  
There's no question, that's a lesson  
I learned from you  
  
[Both]  
You taught me to stand on my own  
  
[Miley] and I thank you for that  
  
[Both]  
You saved me, you made me,  
and now that I'm looking back  
  
[Miley] I can say  
  
[Both] woooaaahhhh!  
  
[Miley] Hmmmm... Hmmmm... Yeah!  
  
[Both]  
I learned from you that  
  
[Miley] I learned from you  
  
[Both]  
I do not crumble  
I learned that strength is something you choose  
  
[Miley] something you choose  
  
[Both]  
All of the reasons to keep on believin',  
  
[Miley] keep on believin'  
  
There's no question, that's a lesson that I learned from you  
  
[Miley]  
Woooaaahhhh!  
I learned from yoooouuu  
  
I learned that strength is something you choose  
[Billy Ray] something you choose  
  
[Both]  
All of the reasons to keep on believin',  
There's no question, that's a lesson that I learned from you  
  
[Miley] yeah!  
  
[Both]  
I learned from you



Take me now baby here as I am  
Pull me close, try and understand  
Desirous hunger is the fire I breathe  
Love is a banquet on which we feed  
  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel when I'm in your hands  
Take my hand come undercover  
They can't hurt you now,  
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to lust  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to us  
  
Have I doubt when I'm alone  
Love is a ring, the telephone  
Love is an angel disguised as lust  
Here in our bed until the morning comes  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel under your command  
Take my hand as the sun descends  
They can't touch you now,  
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
  
With love we sleep  
With doubt the vicious circle  
Turn and burns  
Without you I cannot live  
Forgive, the yearning burning  
I believe it's time, too real to feel  
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
  
Because tonight there are two lovers  
If we believe in the night we trust  
Because tonight there are two lovers



You're trying to tell me something  
Every time I come near  
I got a feeling the message  
Is the one I don't want to hear  
You can deny all you want to  
But I know you enough to know  
Why not come right out and say it  
You've been trying to let me down slow  
So let's talk before the tears drop  
  
You've had a change of heart  
Well I guess that's up to you  
I couldn't change my heart  
Even if I wanted to  
You've had a change of heart  
  
Your kiss sends a message  
And I detect the signs  
I got enough understanding  
Of a lover to realize  
That you can't make him love you  
Though I give you my best  
You're keeping your heart at a distance  
And it breaks me up to confess  
  
Change of heart  
Well I guess that's up to you  
I couldn't change my heart  
Even if I wanted to  
Change of heart  
Baby, everyone to talk to  
You've had a change of heart  
  
Is this just a notion  
A phase that will pass  
A mixed up emotion  
Or is this change gonna last?  
  
Baby let's talk  
Before the tears drop  
  
You've had a change of heart  
Well I guess that's up to you  
I couldn't change my heart  
Even if I wanted to  
Change of heart  
Everyone to talk to  
You've had a change of heart  
Am I losing you, losing you  
  
Change of heart  
I couldn't change my heart  
Am I losing you, losing you  
I couldn't change my heart



When I looked in your eyes  
Felt the spirit of man  
Demanding more than just a smile  
Took a chance for a while  
Speaking in tongues  
That float us down rivers  
The past will remind us  
All colours we chose  
When I told you those lies  
Felt the spirit of love  
Demanding more than compromise  
Took a chance for a while  
Speaking in tongues  
That float us down rivers  
The past will remind us  
All colours we chose  
Some people say that the way that we live  
Is out of this place  
And some people say that the way that we live  
Is blinded by fate  
All colours we chose



Drink down that gin and kerosene  
And come spit on bridges with me just to keep us warm  
Then light a match to leave me be  
Light a match to leave me be  
  
I keep my jealousy close cause it's all mine  
And if you say this makes you happy then I'm not the only one lying  
  
[Chorus]  
Keep quiet  
Nothing comes as easy as you  
Can I lay in your bed all day  
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake  
The hand behind this pen relieves a failure everyday  
Keep quiet  
Nothing comes as easy as you  
Can I lay in your bed all day  
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake  
The hand behind this pen relieves a failure everyday  
  
And I keep my jealousy close cause it's all mine  
And if you say this makes you happy then I'm not the only one lying  
  
Drink down your gin and kerosene  
And come spit on bridges with me just to keep us warm  
Then light a match to leave me be  
Light a match to leave me..  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So wear me like a locket around your throat  
I'll weigh you down  
I'll watch you sulk  
You look so good in blue  
  
You look so good in blue  
So wear me like a locket around your throat  
I'll weigh you down  
I'll watch you choke  
  
You look so good in blue  
You look so good in blue  
So wear me like a locket around your throat  
I'll weigh you down  
  
I'll watch you choke  
You look so good in blue  
You look so good in blue  
  
[Chorus 2x]



Make of our hands, one hand  
Make of our hearts, one heart  
Make of our vows, one last vow  
Only death will part us now  
Make of our lives, one life  
Day after day, one life  
Now it begins, now we start  
One hand, one heart  
Even death won't part us now  
  
There's a place for us  
Somewhere a place for us  
Peace and quiet and open air  
Wait for us somewhere  
  
There's a time for us  
Some day a time for us  
Time together with time to spare  
Time to learn, time to care  
Some day, somewhere  
  
We'll find a new way of living  
We'll find a way of forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
There's a place for us  
A time and place for us  
Hold my hand and we're halfway there  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there  
Somehow, some day  
Somewhere  
  
There's a place for us  
A time and a place for us  
Peace and quiet and open air  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there  
Somehow, some day  
Somewhere  
  
I feel pretty, oh so pretty  
I feel pretty, oh so pretty



So young so strong  
Ignorance is bliss  
Thin skin caught up again  
In a place like this  
  
Big people set the trap for you  
Using you-know-what for brains  
You're just another lab experiment  
And you're easy to replace  
  
Too much too soon  
Sensors overload  
Brought down, chased out of town  
Another dangerous road  
  
Simply a problem of biology  
It's a choice you never make  
The scene is set and you're subjected to  
A lethal dose of growing pains  
  
Think it through  
Logic must be made for fools  
Leave them now  
And be a has-been who never was  
They'll set you up with pains that grow



I believe the sun should never set upon an argument  
I believe we place our happiness in other people's hands  
I believe that junk food tastes so good because it's bad for you  
I believe your parents did the best job they knew how to do  
I believe that beauty magazines promote low self esteem  
I believe I'm loved when I'm completely by myself alone  
  
I believe in Karma what you give is what you get returned  
I believe you can't appreciate real love until you've been burned  
I believe the grass is no more greener on the other side  
I believe you don't know what you've got until you say goodbye  
  
I believe you can't control or choose your sexuality  
I believe that trust is more important than monogamy  
I believe that your most attractive features are your heart and soul  
I believe that family is worth more than money or gold  
I believe the struggle for financial freedom isn't fair  
I believe the only ones who disagree are millionaires  
  
I believe in Karma what you give is what you get returned  
I believe you can't appreciate real love until you've been burned  
I believe the grass is no more greener on the other side  
I believe you don't know what you've got until you say goodbye  
  
I believe forgiveness is the key to your unhappiness  
I believe that wedded bliss negates the need to be undressed  
I believe that God does not endorse TV evangelists  
I believe in love surviving death into eternity  
  
I believe in Karma what you give is what you get returned  
I believe you can't appreciate real love until you've been burned  
I believe the grass is no more greener on the other side  
I believe you don't know what you've got until you say goodbye



Looks like rain  
Sittin down in my crackhouse, earnin my pay  
It's the Southwest Jugglette claimin' Del Ray  
Violent J  
I'm known by the gang squad and police alike  
I'm known to get wrong off the get right  
Hangin' out the truck I blow the moss burg off  
Who da head of yo set?  
I'll blow yo boss shirt off  
I'll be the top dawg killa  
Who da bomb don?  
You're soft like a Bon-Bon in you're Sean John  
I'm ridin' durrtay up and down a Ford Escort  
I'm in a re-mastered gold super-sport  
And it's about to rain  
I see the weather bad  
I hit the top on up like I  
Better had  
I cut back to the cut to get a cut of my cut  
'Cause even in a hurricane a crack-head'll show up  
I be da gang tag K-er  
Gay-fag slayer, bag-weighter  
With a sweet street-sweep ak  
I don't care  
(chorus)x2  
I like the darkness  
It's bout to helly flow  
Tornado sirens  
Let it rain wicked shit  
It's borin' man  
I'm smokin a blunt  
It's pourin' rain  
The hood's soakin it up  
But it's gettin' kinda windy and the walls are shakin  
Fuckin' roof's comin' off I'm in a lazy-boy bakin'  
I see the crack-heads try to reach the porch  
But the wind sweep 'em off before they get to the door  
They only 90 pounds  
Grab somethin' held down cause you're lookin' funny flyin' around  
Fag!  
Blunt wrap on my lap  
Ash all over me  
Playin' Nintendo  
Mega Man iv from '93  
Shudders are shakin and the lightnin' is frightenin'  
Fuckin' windows are breakin'  
Man, I'm thinkin' it might be a tornado  
Go to the door open it up...  
Yup  
All the same back to my game  
It's all right  
As long as that motha fucka stay outside  
I'm tight  
[Chorus:] x2  
Holy fuckin' shit! What the fuck is happelatin'?!  
The whole house spinnin' and shakin'  
Damn near breakin' in half  
I take it and laugh cause what the fuck can I do?  
I put the rocks in my socks so I don't loose them too  
I'm fuckin hangin' on  
I lost all but drawers  
Somehow my game's still good, chillen on pause  
We airborne and in the windows flayin' past by are crack-heads  
Wavin' at me still tryin' to buy  
Mail boxes, a pizza man, some garbage cans, then I seen a naked, ass-bitch
Like  
Damn  
There was all kinda crazy shit caught in the storm  
But before long, all the shit was gone...



All I want to do when I wake up in the morning is see your eyes  
Rosanna, Rosanna  
I never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me, Rosanna  
All I want to do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight  
Rosanna, Rosanna  
  
I didn't know you were looking for more than I could ever be  
Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna  
Now she's gone and I have to say  
  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
  
I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side  
Rosanna, Rosanna  
I didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad, Rosanna  
All I want to tell you is now you'll never ever have to compromise  
Rosanna, Rosanna  
  
I never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad  
Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna  
Now she's gone and I have to say  
  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
  
Not quite a year since she went away,  
Who is it? Rosanna  
Now she's gone and I have to say  
  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna  
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna



I need to feel your heartbeat heartbeat  
So close, feels like mine  
All mine  
I need to feel your heartbeat heartbeat  
So close it feels like mine  
All mine  
  
I remember the feeling  
My hands in your hair  
Hands in your hair  
I remember the feeling  
Of the rhythm we made  
The rhythm we made  
I need to land sometime  
Right next to you  
Feel your heartbeat heartbeat  
Right next to me



Life is a paradise...whoa oh yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven  
I know, I know  
'Cause I've been there with you tonight  
  
I believe life could be paradise once again...  
And the love we thought we lost is sleeping within  
Close your eyes it's something for you  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
I'm a prisoner of hope  
I know  
  
We are young and we are old  
We're fallin' like leaves, like leaves...  
And your heart's so full of soul  
It makes me believe  
Once again, it's something for you...  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
A bridge over time  
Was what you need to see the light, to see the light  
Oh yeah  
Lucky love, lucky love  
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven...  
  
[Chorus x2]



I could hold on for a hundred years  
When all else is gone  
I would still be here  
In a memory of things yet unseen  
I?d remember all that we?ve never been  
And I cannot wait to see  
What life has in store for me  
[chorus]  
In another lifetime  
It would be forever  
In another world  
Where you and I  
Could be together  
In another set of chances  
I?d take the one?s I?d missed  
And make you mine  
If only for a time  
My life would matter  
In another life  
And I?d stay as strong and I?d stay as true  
And you?d have forever now to think it through  
Coz I believe what wasn?t meant to be  
Wasn?t meant for now and  
Someday you?ll see  
In a place and time we never know  
I?d be standing there waiting for you  
[Repeat Chorus]  
[Bridge]  
You would be mine  
But until that time is now  
I?d be holding on somehow  
[Repeat Chorus]  
[Coda]  
But until that time  
I?ll be holding onto forever  
Until another life  



Love is a many splendored thing  
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring  
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living  
The golden crown that makes a man a king  
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist  
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still  
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing  
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing  
  
Love is a many splendored thing  
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring  
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living  
The golden crown that makes a man a king  
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist  
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still  
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing  
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing



I really wouldn't mind it might be fun.  
At any other time with any other one.  
But lovers can't be friends.  
And there's only one way it can end.  
I would lose you,I would lose you.  
  
There are not many girls I can talk with.  
There are not many girls I can walk with.  
And I don't have many friends if any,  
So stay my friend and go away my friend.  
  
I'm really wanting you to go away.  
Everything you do, the things you say.  
Confuse me now and then,  
And I think I love you, my friend.  
Go away,go away.  
  
You're the only girl I have fun with.  
You're the only girl I can run with.  
You know friendship ends where love begins.  
So stay my friend and go away my friend.  
  
You know friendship ends where love begins,  
So stay my friend and go,go away.  
Go away,go away.go away....

Well, say hello to the rap Al Capone, south with pone

Don't get it backwards, Stuck Shore South is home  
Pelle who, soon to be caked out and blown  
Boss of the bosses, Pricehead, Soldier apparel

For rockin' bowling shoes, talk about rocks and shit  
[Cadillac Tah]  
Yo, you bitch niggas is prey, time pay

Hit em' where it hurt most  
You niggas ain't comin' close

Got trick eight to throw more kisses than Jada  
And a bitch serve the guard properly  
She give me blows under the belt like a dirty boxer  
It's R. Cadillac's on twenty-twos  
And jewels that give you cataracts, bitch who you foolin'  
They gave me eight bars, no room to breathe  
And eight darts nigga, no one to leave  
[Fabolous]

Stop, drop, roll out the booth  
Th rims come out the tires

Only thing you should know is that's them hoin'  
This playa comin' back with the 4-5, like M. Jordan  
It's spelled with a capital F  
See everything from the sweater to the scarf to the capital F  
Now with the hoodrats, I'm like the rappin' Hugh hef  
Better known as F-A-be -O-L-O-you-S  
[Hook]

It's time to separate the oil from the cut and gotten the pot  
So when the flame rise niggas gon' respect what's hot  
Four chain glock on em' with no warning

Everybody knows who's the hottest bitch  
And that's why I'm the only bitch on this shit  
And any ho that chu' know love Rem and Nick  
Cause I spit as if I had a dick  
This rap shit I done mastered it, 8-ball assassin chick

Hold on, little girl  
Show me what he's done to you  
Stand up, little girl  
A broken heart can't be that bad  
When it's through, it's through  
Fate will twist the both of you

Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too  
Waited on a line of greens and blues  
Just to be the next to be with you  
  
Why be alone when we can be together, baby?  
You can make my life worth while  
I can make you start to smile  
When it's through, it's through  
And fate will twist the both of you  
Let me be the one to show you

Just to be the next to be with you  
I'm the one who wants to be with you  
Let me be the one to show you

Answer me  
Oh my love  
Just what sin have I been guilty of  
Tell me how I came to lose your love  
Please answer me sweetheart  
  
You were mine yesterday  
I believed that love was here to stay  
Won't you tell me how I've gone astray  
Please answer me my love  
  
If you're happier without me  
I'll try not to care  
But if you still think about me  
Please listen to my prayer  
  
You must know that I've been true  
Won't you say that we can start anew  
In my sorrow now I turn to you  
Please answer me my love  
  
If you're happier without me  
I'll try not to care  
But if you still think about me  
Please listen to my prayer  
  
You must know that I've been true  
Won't you say that we can start anew  
In my sorrow now I turn to you  
Please answer me my love  
Answer me my love



The breaker's war on an unseen shore,  
In the teeth of a hurricane,  
Oh, we struggle in vain  
A hellish night, a ghostly light,  
Appears through the driving rain,  
Salvation in the human chain  
  
All I know that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be
true,  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
thought you knew  
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary, because sometimes the target
is you  
  
Driven to the ground,  
With that awful sound  
Drowned by the cheer from the shore,  
Oh, we wonder what for  
  
The people swarm,  
through the darkening storm,  
Gather everything they can score,  
Turn their backs when there's no more  
  
All I know that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be
true,  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
thought you knew,  
All I know that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be
true,  
All I know that sometimes the truth is contrary, because sometimes the target
is you.  
  
The brink of war on an unseen shore,  
In the teeth of an icy grave,  
In the teeth of an icy grave  
  
Whoah, the human chain leaves a bloody stain,  
Washed away in the pounding waves,  
Washed away in the pounding waves  
  
All I know is sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true,  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of all the things in life
you thought you knew,  
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary, because sometimes the target
is you.  
  
All I know is that memory can be too much to carry,  
striking out like a bull from a balloon,  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
thought you knew



Sittin' in my room staring at the wall  
Wonderin' about the meaning of it all  
Why is it this thing called life  
Has got me goin' crazy  
So I open up your word and let it speak to me  
The purpose and the plan that you've designed  
Is clear to see, and I believe  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna live for today  
I'm gonna follow in your way  
I'm gonna let my little light shine  
Like there's no tomorrow  
I won't worry about the past  
I know my future is intact  
So I'll choose to live my life one way  
I'm gonna live it for today  
  
You told me not to worry  
About what lies ahead  
So I am gonna focus on today instead  
Making every moment count and counting  
Every single blessing  
I'm gonna set my mind on the  
Here and the now  
This is what I want my life to be about  
And this is how  
  
[Chorus]



Little one it's so nice to have you near me  
To feel once again the love you bring here  
Oh my little one, I am sorry for the pain you've felt  
Say the word and daddy will make it disappear  
  
Oh my little one  
Bring your love here  
Little one  
I need you near  
  
Little one  
Don't live in fear of the future  
'Cause I will always be there  
Oh my little one  
  
Music is my life, I hope you understand  
Travelling on the road with me you can see the way we live  
Oh my little one  
I will always cherish these days with you  
  
As time goes by I hope you see the love I tried to give  
Oh my little one  
Let your love flow  
My little one  
  
Like a flower you'll grow  
Someday you'll have your own little one  
And you will always be there  
Little one, it's so nice to have you near me  
  
To feel once again the love you bring here  
Oh my little one, I am sorry for the pain you've felt  
Say the word and daddy will make it disappear  
Oh my little one  
  
Bring your love here  
Little one  
I need you near me  
Little one  
  
Don't live in fear of the future  
'Cause I will always be there  
Oh my little one  
Let your love flow  
  
My little one  
Like a flower you'll grow  
Someday you'll have your own little one  
And you will always be there  
  
My little one...



Thorn in, my side.  
And you live just to pull me down.  
Rusted, nail I stepped on.  
This infection.  
  
Thorn in my side.  
You're full,  
I think so,  
of anger.  
You need to sit down,  
stay down.  
  
The things you, want but don't get.  
Is that fair, I don't think so.  
A sure thing, you can count, on.  
A big depression.  
  
A thorn in my side.  
You're full,  
I think so,  
of anger.  
You need to.  
  
Your praise, is two faced,  
And you're  
you're cut down,  
my friend.  
Cut Down.  
  
A thorn in my side, thorn in.  
A thorn in my side, thorn in.  



I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin  
I wouldn't let my dear savior in  
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light.  
  
Just like a blind man I wandered a long,  
Worries and fears I claimed for my own.  
Then like the blind man that God gave back my sight  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light  
  
I was a fool to wander and stray,  
Straight is the gate and narrow the way  
Now I have traded the wrong for the right  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light  
  
I saw the light, I saw the light  
No more in darkness no more in night  
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight  
Praise the Lord, I saw the light



Love I am told is the deepest mystery  
Harder to fathom than any sea  
More precious than all the earth and sky  
But nobody can tell you why  
Give one heart  
Get back two  
That's the paradox of I love you  
So when you give your heart  
You get one too  
That's the paradox of I love you  
If it is love for which you've cried  
You know how it feels on moon's dark side  
If your baby love's you right  
You can have skyrockets any old night  
Give one heart  
Get back two  
That's the paradox of I love you  
So when you give your heart  
You get one too  
That's the paradox of I love you  
And you can't stop saying it  
I love you  
Can't stop saying it  
I love you  
Keep on saying it saying it  
I won't stop until you say it too  
Love can be gentle soft and tame  
Or so rough you wouldn't know its name  
Shy and wild like a runaway child  
Storms of love always end up mild  
Give one heart  
Get back two  
That's the paradox of I love you  
So when you give your heart  
You get one too  
That's the paradox of I love you  
Give your heart  
Get back two  
That's the paradox of I love you  
So when you give your heart  
Get one too  
That's the paradox of I love you



You never told me you'd be waiting,  
You never told me you'd be there.  
Nothing was said, but it was understood.  
I never doubted that you'd care.  
Another time, another memory,  
Like the light from a burning star.  
Another time you will come back to me  
Like a messenger from afar.  
Now the storm breaks without a warning,  
With no time for us to prepare.  
Now more than ever how I need you.  
I never doubted you'd be there.  
Oh, the prophecy  
Of what it's gonna be  
For you and me,  
Oh, forgive me if I wander  
From the path that we were on.  
You never told me you'd be waiting,  
You never told me you'd be there.  
Now more than ever how I need you.  
I never doubted you'd be there.  



She's lost in the night  
She's out of my sight  
Gotta find her again  
She's out of my life  
Gotta find her again  
Will I ever see the daylight  
Will I ever see the sun  
Will I ever know the reason  
Like a shadow she's gone  
She's lost in the night  
Out of my sight  
Will I find her again  
Taken my life  
Have to find her again  
Will I ever see the daylight  
Will I ever see the dawn  
How can I ever find her  
She's just a shadow  
Missing person  
I don't know where she's gone  
Lost one love, last seen somewhere  
Walkin' away from the light  
Lost one love, somewhere last seen  
Walkin' into the night, she's gone  
Will I ever see the daylight  
Will I ever see the sun  
Can I ever know the reason  
Like a shadow, missing person  
I don't know where she's gone  
Lost one love, last seen somewhere  
Walkin' away from the light  
Lost one love, somewhere last seen  
Walkin' into the night  
She's lost in the night  
And I don't the reason  
Will I find her again  
She's out of my sight  
But I can't lose this feeling  
Will I find her again  



If you come to me, that's all that I remember  
Come to me, before I fade away  
  
Here we are, how did we come so far  
Just tell me how you are, I need to know  
Night has come to see the senses run  
And every single one, we all must show  
  
And when you feel the flood upon the waters edge  
And take the leap from bitter sweet  
Do you believe, do you believe  
Do you still believe  
  
If you come to me, that's all that I remember  
Come to me, before I fade away  
If you come to me and wrap me in your splendour  
Come to me and let the music play  
  
In the sea of those eyes, in the fall of the rise  
There is no compromise  
  
If you come to me, that's all that I remember  
Won't you come to me, before I fade away  
If you come to me and wrap me in your splendour  
Come to me and let the music play  
Won't you come to me  
  



Tear up the photographs  
But yesterday won't let go  
Every day every day every minute  
Here comes the emptiness  
Just can't leave lonely alone  
Every day every day hey hey  
This second-chancin's really getting me down  
You give and takin' everything I dreamed about  
It's time you let me know let me know just let go  
  
[Chorus]  
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted  
Was a simple way to get over you  
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted  
Was an in-between to escape this desperate scene  
Where every lie reveals the truth  
Baby cause all I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted was you  
  
I'd rather walk alone  
Don't wanna chase you around  
Every day every day every minute I'd fall a thousand times  
For I let you drag me down  
Every day every day hey hey  
Your new beginning was a perfect ending  
But I keep feeling we've already been here before  
It's time you let me know let me know just let go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me with so many out there  
Why I always turn to you  
Your goodbyes tear me down every time  
And it's so easy to see that the blame is on me  
  
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted  
Was a simple way to get over you  
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted  
Was an in-between to escape this desperate scene  
  
[Chorus]



Her eyes, her eyes  
Make the stars look like they're not shining  
Her hair, her hair  
Falls perfectly without her trying  
She's so beautiful  
And I tell her everyday (yeah)  
  
I know, I know  
When I compliment her she won't believe me  
And it's so, it's so  
Sad to think that she don't see what I see  
But every time she asks me "Do I look okay?"  
I say,  
  
When I see your face  
There's not a thing that I would change  
'Cause you're amazing  
Just the way you are  
And when you smile  
The whole world stops and stares for a while  
'Cause girl you're amazing  
Just the way you are  
  
Her lips, her lips  
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me  
Her laugh, her laugh  
She hates but I think it's so sexy  
She's so beautiful  
And I tell her everyday  
  
Oh you know, you know, you know  
I'd never ask you to change  
If perfect's what you're searching for  
Then just stay the same  
So don't even bother asking if you look okay  
You know I'll say,  
  
When I see your face  
There's not a thing that I would change  
'Cause you're amazing  
Just the way you are  
And when you smile  
The whole world stops and stares for a while  
'Cause girl you're amazing  
Just the way you are  
  
The way you are  
The way you are  
Girl you're amazing  
Just the way you are, yeah  
  
When I see your face  
There's not a thing that I would change  
'Cause you're amazing  
Just the way you are  
And when you smile  
The whole world stops and stares for a while  
'Cause girl you're amazing  
Just the way you are



It doesn't really matter that I loved you  
How many reasons call  
It doesn't really matter at all  
It doesn't really matter that I failed to  
Break down your father's wall  
It doesn't really matter at all  
  
Why tell me you don't understand when you do  
I thought I had something to say  
  
But it doesn't really matter at all...  
I changed my name to be rid of the things that I want from you  
It's strange but the name is a name and the truth is a truth  
  
Oh, there is always, always someone there to remind me  
So I learn to live with shame  
I tell myself I feel no pain  
But I do and if I have to tell you  
  
Then it doesn't really matter at all...  
And it's no good looking back  
Because time is a thief and I believe that I'm too old for that  
We're just saying the things that we have said forever  
  
It doesn't really matter that I loved you  
How many reasons fall  
It's too bad  
It really doesn't matter at all



I bless the day I found you  
I want to stay around you  
And so I beg you  
Let it be me  
  
Don't take this heaven from one  
If you must cling to someone  
Now and forever  
Let it be me  
  
Each time we meet, love  
I find complete love  
Without your sweet love  
What would life be?  
  
So never leave me lonely  
Tell me you love me only  
And that you'll always  
Let it be me  
  
Each time we meet, love  
I find complete love  
Without your sweet love  
What would life be?  
  
So never leave me lonely  
Tell me you love me only  
And that you'll always  
Let it be me



Well, you know I can be found, sitting all alone  
If you can't come around at least please telephone  
Don't be cruel, to a heart that's true  
  
Baby, if I made you mad (bop bop bop)  
For something I might have said (bop bop)  
Please forget my past (bop bop bop)  
The future looks bright ahead (bop bop bop bop bop)  
But don't be cruel, to a heart that's true  
I don't want no other love, baby, it's just you I'm thinking of  
  
Don't stop thinking of me, don't make me feel this way  
Come on over and love me, you know I want you to stay  
Don't be cruel, to a heart that's true  
  
Let's walk down to the preacher (bop bop bop)  
Let's say, hey I do (bop bop)  
And then I know you'll want me (bop bop bop)  
And you'll know I want you too (bop bop bop bop bop)  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
I don't want no other love, baby, it's just you I'm thinking of  
  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Don't need no other love, baby  
It's just you I'm thinking of, hey hey hey  
  
Don't stop thinking of me, don't make me feel this way  
Come on over and love me, you know I want you to stay  
Don't be cruel, to a heart that's true  
Why should we be apart, baby you know I love you, cross my heart  
  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true [Repeat: x5]  
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true  
Don't want no other love, baby it's just you I'm thinking of



Well, here we are again  
I guess it must be fate  
We've tried it on our own  
But deep inside we've known  
We'd be back to set things straight  
I still remember when your kiss was so brand new  
Every memory repeats  
Every step I take retreats  
Every journey always brings me back to you  
  
After all the stops and starts  
We keep comin' back to these two hearts  
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall  
After all that we've been through  
It all comes down to me and you  
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all  
  
When love is truly right  
(This time it's truly right)  
It lives from year to year  
It changes as it goes  
Oh, and on the way it grows  
But it never disappears  
  
After all the stops and starts  
We keep comin' back to these two hearts  
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall  
After all that we've been through  
It all comes down to me and you  
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all  
  
Always just beyond my touch  
You know I needed you so much  
After all, what else is livin' for?  
  
After all the stops and starts  
We keep comin' back to these two hearts  
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall  
After all that we've been through  
It all comes down to me and you  
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all  



Tinker, you better place another bet  
The rich up in the castle haven't finished eating yet  
They'll throw you a bone or a spat-out stone  
But knowing them that's all you'll get  
Tailor, you better close another shop  
No-one wants your quality, make do with what you've got  
They'll let you survive  
The'll let you get by  
But knowing them, they'll let you rot  
  
You better be doubtful  
You better beware  
You better not shout now  
You better not care  
  
Tinker, you better buy another boot  
Those "Pocock Continental" are finally showing through  
We'll get you a pair  
From a second-hand fair  
They'll only have 'a two'  
  
Sailor, you better sink a few more ships  
Admiral loony Nelson cannot find his game of risk  
We'll lose a few lives  
A couple of tribes  
But knowing him he'll like his lips  
  
You better be doubtful  
You better beware  
You better not shout now  
You better not care  
  
From Queen Wilkinds to Queen Victoria  
We've had a promising side  
From King Callaghan to Bonny Prince Francis  
We've paid up and we've cried  
Princess Gower and Princess Ferguson  
We've looked a hard nut to crack  
But we're weak at the.........Back!



I like to look at shadows sweating on the wall  
I get excited when I hear footsteps in the hall  
Outside your balcony I have a room with a view  
And I'm watching you  
  
I dial your telephone each and every afternoon  
I wait by your door till you're asleep at night  
And when you're alone I know when you  
Turn out the light  
  
I'm gonna get close to you  
Oh-Oh so close to you  
I'm gonna get close to you  
I'm gonna get close  
  
You fumble for your keys  
I'm six or seven steps behind you  
I'm so close to you  
Are you terrified of me? What do I know about you  
How did I find out?  
You think I'm a fool or maybe some kind of lunatic  
Say I'm wasting my time but I know what to do with it  
It's as plain as black and white  
  
I'm gonna get close to you  
Oh-Oh so close to you  
I'm gonna get close to you  
Oh so close  
  
If you knew my infinite charm  
There'd be no reason to be so alarmed  
Maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm right  
Maybe I'm some kind of lunatic  
You say I'm wasting all of my time  
But I know what to do with it  
It is plain as black and white  
  
I'm gonna get close to you  
Oh-Oh so close to you  
I'm gonna get close to you  
I'm like a hungry Criminal  
and your protection is minimal  
So minimal  



There's three in the wall from those pictures in the closet  
Two in the bedroom from that night I lost it  
One deep inside me determined to stay  
They don't get any bigger but they don't go away  
  
Holes in and around me I keep falling back into  
Holes digging its around me  
God knows what I'm gonna do  
To fill in these holes left by you  
Left by you  
  
I pour drink after drink but nothing hit bottom  
I've been on my knees admitted my problem  
The love that we made still barely an echo  
I'll try anything in these vacant hollow  
  
Holes in and around me I keep falling back into  
Holes digging its around me  
God knows what I'm gonna do  
To fill in these holes left by you  
Left by you  
  
There's two through my hands and one through my feet  
From this cross that I bear until the day that I see



She moves with a tender kiss  
And I can't stop feelin'  
She soothes with a tenderness  
And I can't stop' feelin'  
Well, I don't even know her name  
But I can't stop feelin'  
She says that she feels the same  
And I can't stop feelin'  
And if you let me try tonight  
You just might see that I'm  
  
Fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
Ah yeah  
  
She turns chaos into art  
And I can't stop feelin'  
A touch and I fall apart  
And I can't stop feelin'  
It's soundin' like an old cliche  
And I can't stop feelin'  
I love her in a thousand ways  
And I can't stop feelin'  
And if you let me try tonight  
You just might see that I'm  
  
Fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
Ah yeah  
  
Well, every simple notion is poetry in motion  
Can't you see it's pushin' me over the edge?  
This wreckin' ball you're holdin' has crushed the heart you've stolen  
I'll give you my devotion all over again  
And if you let me try tonight  
You just might see that I'm  
  
That I'm fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
Yeah  
  
And I'm fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
  
And I'm fallin' deeper and deeper and deeper in love  
And I'm feelin' more and more and more and more alone  
Ah yeah



I gave up cigarettes, haven't had to light one yet.  
It's been a year sense I stopped.  
Same goes for alcohol.  
I don't touch the stuff at all.  
I used to drink till I dropped.  
  
[CHORUS:]  
But those were tough this is easy, and it feels  
So good to say. Forgetting you is not that hard to do  
For I've done it a thousand times a day. Oh I've done it a  
Thousand times a day.  
  
Friends said it would take some time to get you off my mind.  
Some said I'd never let you go. But, I guess I've proved  
Them wrong. One more bad habit gone.  
Just like the whiskey and the smokes.  
But those were tough this is easy, and I'm  
All right I'm ok.  
Forgetting  
  
(CHORUS:)  
  
I've given you up for good, just like I said I would.  
Oh the night you walked away.  
But that was tough this is easy,  
  
( CHORUS:)



Big wheels keep on turning  
Carry me home to see my kin  
Singing songs about the Southland  
I miss Alabamy once again  
And I think it's a sin, yes  
Well I heard mister Young sing about her  
Well, I heard ole Neil put her down  
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember  
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
  
In Birmingham they love the governor  
Now we all did what we could do  
Now Watergate does not bother me  
Does your conscience bother you?  
Tell the truth  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
Here I come Alabama  
  
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers  
And they've been known to pick a song or two  
Lord they get me off so much  
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue  
Now how about you?  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Oh sweet home baby  
Where the skies are so blue  
And the governor's true  
Sweet Home Alabama  
Lordy  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
Yea, yea Montgomery's got the answer



Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals  
I get my back into my living  
I don't need to fight, to prove I'm right  
I don't need to be forgiven  
  
Don't cry, don't raise your eye  
It's only teenage wasteland  
  
Sally, take my hand  
Well travel south, 'cross land  
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder  
  
The exodus is here  
The happy ones are near  
Let's get together before we get much older  
  
Teenage wasteland  
It's only teenage wasteland  
Teenage wasteland  
(it's only) teenage wasteland  
  
They're all wasted!



Many a tear has to fall but it's all in the game  
All in the wonderful game that we know as love  
You have words with him and your future's looking dim  
But these things your hearts can rise above  
  
Once in a while he won't call but it's all in the game  
Soon he'll be there at your side with a sweet bouquet  
And he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips  
And your heart will fly away  
  
(Soon he'll be there at your side) with a sweet bouquet  
Then he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips  
And your heart will fly away



Gonna buy me a long white robe  
Yes Lord to help me home  
I'm gonna buy me a long white robe  
Yes Lord to get me home  
And when I get my heavenly gown  
And I lay my burden down  
I'm gonna get me a long white robe  
To get me home  
  
I'm gonna buy me two golden slippers  
Yes Lord to walk me home  
I'm gonna buy me two golden slippers  
Yes Lord to walk me home  
And when I get my slippers of gold  
Then the Lord will have my soul  
I'm gonna get me two golden slippers  
To get me home  
  
I'm gonna buy me two wings of silver  
Yes Lord to fly me home  
I'm gonna buy me two wings of silver  
Yes Lord to fly me home  
And when I get my silvery wings  
Then an angel choir will sing  
I'm gonna get me two wings of silver  
To get me home  
  
I'm gonna buy me a poor man's trouble  
Yes Lord to help me home  
I'm gonna buy me a poor man's trouble  
Yes Lord to help me home  
And when I get my trouble and woe  
Then homeward I will go  
I'm gonna get a little trouble  
And woe to get me home  
  
I'm gonna find me a smilin' angel  
Yes Lord to lead me home  
I'm gonna get me a smilin' angel  
Yes Lord to lead me home  
And when he takes me by the hand  
I know the Lord will understand  
I'm gonna get me a smilin' angel to lead me home  
I'm gonna get me a smilin' angel to lead me home

Your messiah was never mine  
  
Hypocrites!  
Weeping rows of Jeremiah  
Drops of blood drip off your medals  
Representing all our tears  
in a ring of burning metal  
  
How you wanna be, what you gonna say  
it doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay

To define the what and why  
People travel across this earth  
Over water, land, and sky  
  
How you wanna be, what you gonna say  
it doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay  
  
Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver  
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars

I'm not gonna pay it's already mine  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
Your messiah was never mine  
Weeping rows of Jeremiah  
Purity unlike no other  
Offers help to those who need it  
Don't forget care to the brother  
  
How you wanna be, what you gonna say it  
Doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay  
Little lady at home  
Writing out a check to send  
It's all the money that she owns  
She believes the world might end  
  
How you wanna be, what you gonna say it  
Doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay  
  
Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver  
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars

Love takes the patience of Job  
That's what my Mama always said  
Faith is the belief in something more than what you know  
That's what the Good Book says  
You gotta play the cards you got  
Who knows what fate is holding  
At times you gotta go without knowing where you're going  
  
That's why I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you  
Through the baby don't leave mes  
And never will agains  
And I promise tos  
I keep on lovin' you  
  
Lord knows we've had our share of fights  
Our sleepless nights, our ups and downs  
We've had plenty and then some of baby I'm gones and turnarounds  
Sometimes I swear it might be easier to throw in the towel  
Someday we're gonna look back  
Say look at us now  
  
That's why I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you  
Through the baby don't leave mes  
And never will agains  
And I promise tos  
I keep on lovin' you  
  
Keep on lovin' you  
Through the I take it backs  
I didn't mean it like that's  
I'd never hurt yous  
Oh, I keep on lovin' you  
  
I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you  
Through the I take it backs  
I didn't mean it like that  
I'd never hurt yous  
Oh, I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you  
I keep on lovin' you



Remember back when I was born  
High up in the sky  
Looking down upon the scene  
I can't recall just why  
A white love light come up to me  
I followed it back down  
Sayin' this is the tune of the Earth, my friends  
When I want to be around  
  
I want to be around  
When the stars fall on the ground  
Walking hand in hand with every man  
Sleeping in the sun with everyone  
  
Abraham, come in one more time  
It must have been in L.A.  
He just said, "Joe, won't you stay?"  
"All right, okay," he said to me  
"I got nothing else to do."  
So Abe walked in, he's back again  
Until his life is through  
  
He's going to be around  
While a whole new world goes down  
Walking hand in hand with every man  
Sleeping in the sun with everyone  
  
Every night by morning light  
I look up on the hill  
Digging all the cosmic sights  
And I recognize it's Will  
I said, "Oh well, it's getting time  
I'm beginning to feel my load."  
  
He said, "Don't worry, brother  
'Cause you and the others  
Will see it out on the road."  
  
And I want to be around  
When all over this world  
You can't hear a sound 'cept everyone  
Singing songs of glory in the sun



Take the line between us  
And hold it close to you,  
I want us to get together,  
Like lovers do.  
  
Let me kiss away your troubles,  
The cold and lonely nights,  
Just take this heart I'm giving  
And love is on the rise.  
  
Like lovers do  
Want to hold you through the night,  
Like lovers do  
And when I look into your eyes,  
  
Like lovers do  
Oh I'm drowning in an ocean of emotion.  
It feels just like forever  
Since I made love to you,  
  
September days of scarlet,  
April morning dew.  
So take the love between us  
And hold it close to you,  
  
I want us to get together  
Like lovers do



If you want to know  
  
Tomorrow morning I have to leave  
But wherever I may be  
Best believe I'm thinking of you  
I can't believe how much I love you  
All we have is here tonight  
We don't want to waste this time  
Give me something to remember  
Baby put your lips on mine  
  
And I'll love you forever  
Any time that we find ourselves apart,  
  
Just close your eyes  
And you'll be here with me  
Just look to your heart  
And that's where I'll be  
If you just close your eyes  
Till you're drifting away  
You'll never be too far from me  
If you close your eyes  
  
I know I'm gonna see you again  
But promise me that you won't forget  
Cause as long as you remember  
A part of us will be together  
So even when you're fast asleep  
Look for me inside your dreams  
Keep believing in what we're sharing  
And even when I'm not there to tell you  
  
I'll, I'll love, love you forever  
Any time that I can't be where you are,  
  
You just close your eyes  
And you'll be here with me  
Just look to your heart  
And that's where I'll be  
Just close your eyes  
Till you're drifting away  
You'll never be too far from me  
If you close your eyes  
  
Is there anywhere that far?  
Any time you're feeling low  
Is there anywhere that love cannot reach?  
Oh no  
It could be anywhere on earth  
It could be anywhere I'll be  
Oh baby if you want to see  
  
Just close your eyes and you'll be here with me  
Look to your heart and that's where you'll be  
Just close your eyes till you're drifting away  
You'll never be too far from me



1, 2, 3, 4  
Though the days are long  
Twilight sings a song  
Of a happiness that used to be  
Soon my eyes will close  
(Soon my eyes will close)  
Soon I'll find repose  
And in dreams, you're always near to me  
I'll see you in my dreams  
Hold you in my dreams  
Someone took you out of my arms  
Still, I feel the thrill of your charms  
Lips that once were mine  
Tender eyes that shine  
They will light our way tonight  
I'll see you in my dreams  
In the dreary gray  
Of another day  
You are far away and I am blue  
Still I hope and pray  
(Still I hope and pray)  
Through each weary day  
For it brings the night and dreams of you  
I'll see you in my dreams  
Hold you in my dreams  
Someone took you out of my arms  
Still, I feel the thrill of your charms  
Lips that once were mine  
Tender eyes that shine  
They will light our way tonight  
I'll see you in my dreams  
They will light our way tonight  
I'll see you in my dreams  



I don't understand about complementary colors  
And what they say  
Side by side they both get white  
Together they both get gray  
  
But he's been pretty much yellow  
And I've been cryin' blue  
But all I can see is  
Red, red, red, red, red now  
What am I to do  
  
I don't understand about  
Diamonds and why men buy them  
What's so impressive about a diamond  
Except the mining  
  
And it's dangerous work  
Trying to get to you too  
And I think if I didn't have to  
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill myself doing it  
Maybe I wouldn't listen so much to you  
  
I've been watching all the time  
And I still can't find the track  
And I want to know is it okay  
Is it just fine  
Was it my fault  
Is it my lack  
  
I don't understand about  
The weather outside  
The harbinger to the words  
That somebody lied  
  
There's solace a bit for submitting  
To the fitfully cryptically true  
What's happened has happened  
What's coming is already on its way  
With a role for me to play  
  
I don't understand  
I'll never understand  
But I'm trying to understand  
There's nothing else I can do

Gonna get myself together, take a ride downtown

Doctor rock will help you anytime at all  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor  
Gotta see him, see him today  
He gonna blow me away  
Oh, right away



Awakened I have become  
Light now slips away  
Manipulate your mind  
Darkness is my slave  
  
Taste the sins of Hell  
The blood that I so crave  
The last thing that you see  
Is the hunger in my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
Blood sucking creatures of the night  
Nocturnal spectre hiding from the light  
Cries screaming out every fright  
Eagerly awaiting plight  
Apparitions from the pits of Hell  
Death plagues the streets in which they dwell  
Demented lust, the secrets they must keep  
Addicted to your blood  
At dawn they sleep  
  
Unveil the hidden coffin  
Lift the lid of terror  
Feel the deadly cold  
Freeze you from inside  
  
Perceiving your intentions  
To slay the phantom form  
Raise the stake in malice  
You cannot plunge it down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Beware the image unseen  
Stalks your soul  
Your corpse's redeem  
  
Eternal damnation you just reward  
A servant of our Lord  
By your accord  
  
Admonish of the cruciform  
Impalement  
Immortality's scorned  
  
Rise hold fast your faith  
To lie dormant  
Is certain Death  
  
(Driven by the instinct of centuries of horror  
Implanted along the brain of the sickening parasite  
Linked together by one trait  
The Hell-filled need to kill, kill, kill, kill, kill)  
  
Emerging from their Hellish tomb  
Taking flight amidst the night  
The evening skies are raining Death  
  
Swooping down from shadowed skies  
Taking simple human form  
Shed their wings to stalk the mortal man  
  
Lock their jaws into your veins  
Satanic soldiers strike their prey  
Leaving corpses waiting for the change  
  
Blood dripping from the jaws of Death  
Not enough to satisfy  
They must drain your soul of life



Looking for a lady  
I'm looking for a lady  
To change my night to day  
  
Looking for a lady  
I'm looking for a lady  
To chase my blues away.  
  
Well, I have a few in mind  
But none in particular  
I have had them before  
But nothing that was for sure.  
  
And I'm in no position to barter  
And I'm in no condition to play the martyr  
And I'm sadder certainly  
But I'm smarter  
And I find myself.  
  
Looking for a lady  
I'm looking for a lady  
To share my empty bed  
Looking for a lady  
I'm looking for a lady  
To soothe my aching head.  
  
Well, I have a few in mind  
But none in particular  
I have had them before  
But nothing that was for sure.  
  
And my feelings have grown  
Rigid like a wooden post.  
And my love is like a curtain  
That has been drawn closed  
And my life just isn't going  
The way I thought it was supposed to  
And I'm crying and I find myself.  
  
Looking for a lady  
I'm looking for a lady  
To change my night to day.



(kirsty maccoll)  
Maybe it's imaginary, I'd like to know  
What's the world coming to and where will it go?  
The hole in the sky where the sunshine gets in  
It dries up the land as it mucks up your skin  
And I don't know why, who will reveal?  
Maybe it's imaginary, maybe it's real  
We wash all the food and we peel off the skin  
But what is the point if it's poisoned within?  
Now I don't know why we say ok  
Maybe it's imaginary, hope it's not too late  
And when in the summer we go to the sea  
The things floating by aren't what we want to see  
And I'd change it all if I had one wish  
I'd never go swimming with those nuclear fish  
Maybe those imaginary rivers run dry  
But if it's true then I'd like to know why  
I don't know much but I'd like to know why  



Now kids hang on just a second before we start  
You know there's a reason we are all here in front of Grandma and  
Grandpa's  
Christmas tree  
And if Trevor and E.P. would quit fighting long enough and be real quiet  
This little song might help ya understand  
Long ago in a stable there was a baby being born  
His parents were Joseph and Mary  
And Joseph's big ole heart was torn  
Cause he couldn't find a decent place for Mary to have her child  
But Mary said it just seemed just right and she blessed it with her  
Smile  
Cause what made it special was the baby in her arms  
God sent Him down to give the world a second chance for you and I  
That's why we have Christmas at this time each year  
It's the baby's birthday party that brings us so much cheer  
Now kids the presents that all of you exchange on Christmas  
Represents the gifts that baby Jesus received the night he was born  
He got all his presents from three wise men  
Who followed a star  
And walked a long long way to the stable  
So everytime you tear open one of your presents  
Think about that baby and say  
Happy birthday Jesus  
I'll open this one for you  
Cause what made it special was the baby in her arms  
God sent Him down to give the world a second chance for you and I  
That's why we have Christmas at this time each year  
It's the baby's birthday party that brings us so much cheer  
OK all together now  
Happy Birthday Jesus  
I'll open this one just for you  



[Verse:]  
I just sit here waiting for you to call  
Then I wonder if you're even calling at all  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just live without you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I'm still sitting here waiting for much more (Text me or something)  
I can't take this, I'm walking out that door  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without you  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I pack up my things and get on that plane  
Cause without you I can't be tamed  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just live without you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without you  
  
[Bridge:]  
Please girl stay with me  
My heart is waiting for you  
I can't take this no more  
There's nothing I should do  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without  
  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without you  
  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you



Walking stiff let me tall ya'  
Better left for dead  
And now we are on a mission  
Well it's full speed ahead  
My legion's when we do the crime  
Let's get one thing straight  
To get there early is on time  
And showing up on time is late  
Ladies and gents, we're still alive  
By the skin of our teeth, now it's killing time  
Angel in our pocket, devil by our side  
We ain't going nowhere, 'cuz heroes never die  
Still alive  
Blood of heroes  
Never die  
They never die  
We've been run down every hill  
Chased up all the dead end streets  
But if you try to cut us out  
You'll get a kick in the teeth  
Ladies and Gents, we're still alive  
By the skin of our teeth, now it's killing time  
Fasten up you head belts,  
Time to ride the skies  
It's time to be immortal, 'cuz heroes never die  



Say my name, and his in the same breath,  
I dare you to say they taste the same,  
Let the leaves fall off in the summer  
And let December glow in flames  
  
Erase myself and let go,  
Start it over again in Mexico  
These friends, they don't love you  
They just love the hotel suites, now  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't care what you think,  
As long as it's about me  
The best of us can find happiness, in misery  
I don't care what you think,  
As long as it's about me  
The best of us can find happiness, in misery  
  
Oh, take a chance, let your body get a tolerance,  
I'm not a chance, but a heat wave in your pants  
Pull a breath like another cigarette,  
Pawn shop heart trading up, said no  
  
I'm the oracle in my chest,  
Let the guitar scream like a fascist,  
Sweat it out, shut your mouth,  
Free love on the streets, but  
In the alley it ain't that cheap now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Said-a, I don't care just a-what you think,  
As long as it's about me, you said-a  
I don't care just what you think,  
As long as it's about me, you said-a  
I don't care (I don't care)  
You said I don't care (I don't care)  
Said I don't care, I don't care  
I don't care (I don't care), I said-a, I don't care  
  
[Chorus]



I had not planned on seeing you  
I was afraid of what I'd do  
But pride is strong, here am I  
And I just can't let you say goodbye  
  
Please have no fear, you're in no harm  
As long as you're here in my arms  
But you can't leave so please don't try  
But I just can't let you say goodbye  
  
What force behind your evil mind  
Can let your lips speak so unkind  
To one who loves as much as I  
I just can't let you say goodbye  
  
The flesh around your throat is pale  
Intended by my fingernails  
Please don't scream and please don't cry  
Cause I just can't let you say goodbye  
  
Your voice is still, it speaks no more  
You'll never hurt me anymore  
Death is a friend to love and I  
Cause now you'll never say goodbye



Will you remember me baby?  
One day you should go away  
I know you say you'll always stay  
Oh, but life takes funny turns at times  
And has a way of changing minds  
No, I could never be your friend  
(Be your friend)  
To me the end would be the end  
But we've shared so much happiness  
Just remember, ohh baby  
(Remember)  
I know you tell me every day  
You'll love me till the end of time  
I tell it to you just in case  
Someday, you are no longer mine  
Just one thing I'll ask of you  
(One thing baby)  
'cause both of us have much to lose  
For all the things we've made it through  
Just remember, please, remember  
(Baby c'mon, baby c'mon, baby c'mon, oh)  
Remember me with love baby  
(Remember)  
Remember me with love  
(Don't you forget to remember)  
No matter where or when  
(Where or when)  
If you think of me again  
(Remember me with love)  
Remember me with love  
Remember me with love baby  
(Will you remember me baby? Remember, will you remember?)  
Remember me with love  
(Will you remember me baby? Will you remember?)  
I know you care for me  
(Care for me)  
But if one day you set me free  
(Remember me with love)  
Remember me with love  
(Do you remember me baby? Do you remember me?)  
Seems like everywhere I turn  
Somebody else is breakin' up  
I know as far as I'm concerned with you  
I'll always be in love  
But if one day you feel differently  
All you have to do, is come to me  
I will let you go so easily  
But remember, please, remember  
(Baby c'mon, baby c'mon, baby c'mon, oh)  
Remember me with love baby  
(Remember)  
Remember me with love, everyday  
(Don't you forget to remember)  
No matter where or when  
(Where or when)  
If you think of me again  
(Remember me with love)  
Remember me with love  
Remember me with love baby  
(Will you remember me baby? Remember, will you remember?)  
Remember me with love  
(Will you remember me baby? Will you remember?)  
(Don't you forget, don't you forget)  
I know you care for me  
(Care for me)  
But if one day you set me free  
(Remember me with love)  
Remember me with love  
Remember me with love  
(Remember me with love)  



Minutes seem like days  
Since fire ruled the sky  
The rich became the beggars  
And the fools became the wise  
Memories linger in my brain  
Of burning from the acid rain  
A pain I never have won  
  
Nothing here remains  
No future and no past  
No one could foresee  
The end that came so fast  
Hear the prophet make his guess  
That paradise lies to the west  
So join his quest for the sun  
  
Shades of death are all I see  
Fragments of what used to be  
  
The world slowly decays  
Destruction fills my eyes  
Harboring the image  
Of a spiraling demise  
Burning winds release their fury  
Simulating judge and jury  
Drifting flurries of pain  
  
Deafening silence reigns  
As twilight fills the sky  
Eventual supremacy  
Daylight waits to die  
Darkness always calls my name  
A pawn in this recurring game  
Humanity going insane  
  
Shades of death are all I see  
Fragments of what used to be  
  
Minutes seem like days  
Corrosion fills the sky  
Morbid dreams of anarchy  
Brought judgment in disguise  
Memories linger in my brain  
Life with nothing more to gain  
Perpetual madness remains  
  
Shades of death are all I see  
Skeletons of society  
Fragments of what used to be  
Skeletons of society



The hardest thing in the world  
  
Holland it don't please  
I never wanted to leave  
Searching for a perfect day  
It never happens that way  
Ahey hey hey  
  
I'm sick and tired  
It's so obscene  
Will heaven help me be clean?  
Searching for a perfect day  
It never happens that way  
Ahey hey hey  
  
Cut away, I know no one wants you around  
  
You never heard a word I said  
It's seems simple to me  
That if you knew you wouldn't say  
It never happens that way  
Ahey hey hey  
  
And the impression I get  
As the story unfurls  
Is that you're the hardest thing in the world  
  
Cut away, I know no one wants you around  
  
What you feel might not be  
It seems softer to me  
I cannot climb to touch your spire  
I'm getting higher and higher  
  
Cut away, I know no one wants you around  
The hardest thing in the world



My heart is filled, with love and care  
Not an ounce of gas, I would get up there  
The answer's simple  
You lift me up  
The view up here, I see all the stars  
There go Venus, and there go Mars  
Somethin' you been through  
You're from above  
  
Hey, when I first saw you, I got excited  
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it  
But I didn't know  
I didn't let go  
Then it occurred to me while tryna fight it  
Just like a kite, you learn to ride it  
But I didn't know  
You're s'posed to let it go  
  
Like a gust of wind  
You hit me off sometimes  
Like a gust of wind  
You push me back every once in a while  
Like a gust of wind  
You remind me there's someone up there  
Who whooshes in  
The air I need to power myself  
  
When I open the window  
I wanna hug you  
'Cause you remind me of the air  
I said yeah  
'Cause when I'm feelin' real low  
I remember I love you  
I put my hands in the air  
And you were there  
  
With your love, I can board the skies  
Finding a way that electrifies, mother's your other  
Cannot stow away  
Telephone winds of the northern sky  
Is the closest thing, and here is why  
'Cause we're color  
You blow me away  
  
I need you, like I'm breathing  
Music umbrellas can make one cover  
Who cares if they don't see you?  
Don't you know that they're the same?  
I need it like I'm breathing  
If you never discover, forever you'll suffer  
Who cares if they don't see you?  
You got until then to learn the way  
  
Like a gust of wind  
You hit me off sometimes  
Like a gust of wind  
You push me back every once in a while  
Like a gust of wind  
You remind me there's someone up there  
Who whooshes in  
The air I need to power myself  
  
When I open the window  
I wanna hug you  
'Cause you remind me of the air  
I said yeah  
'Cause when I'm feelin' real low  
I remember I love you  
I put my hands in the air  
And you were there  
  
When I first saw you, I got excited  
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it  
But I didn't know  
I didn't let go  
Then I realized I'm tryna fight it  
Just so they can learn to ride it  
But I didn't know  
I had to let it go



Blue, I'm getting kinda close to you  
Like a shadow I can't lose  
Hey, you've been hangin' with me every day  
Now you're gettin' in my way  
I know you understand me  
But don't ya think that maybe it's time to move on  
  
[Chorus]  
What's up lonely  
Seems you're my only  
Friend who wants to share my pain  
Tell me heartache  
What's it gonna take  
For you to leave me alone today  
Just when I think that you're gone  
You're in the mirror lookin' back at me  
So what's up lonely  
  
Sometimes, I wish you weren't by my side  
Can't you find another shoulder, cause I  
I want to leave this broken heart behind  
We been wastin' too much time  
Find someone else to rain on  
I'm really getting' tired of singin' this sad song  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't want to give you a reason  
To hang around anymore  
You won't be hurting my feelings  
If you find another broken heart you can lean on



It's a sad affair  
When there's no one there  
He calls out in the night  
And it's so unfair  
At least it seems that way  
When you gave him his life  
  
And all this time he's been getting you down  
You ought to pick him up when there's no one around  
And convince him  
Just talk to him  
'cause he knows in his heart you won't be home soon  
He's an only child in an only room  
And he's dependent on you  
  
And it seems so strange  
That at the end of the day  
Making love can be so good  
But the Pain of birth  
What is it worth  
When it don't turn out the way it should



Long distance information, give me Memphis Tennessee  
Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me  
She could not leave her number, but I know who placed the call  
Cause my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall  
  
Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie  
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis Tennessee  
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge  
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge  
  
Help me, information, more than that I cannot add  
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had  
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree  
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee  
  
Last time I saw Marie she's waving me good-bye  
With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye  
Marie is only six years old, information please  
Try to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee



I never found out why you walked away  
And never said good-bye  
But now that I see you  
I'm torn inside, but I've still got my pride  
  
I understand that some things are better left unsaid  
I'm afraid of the truth  
But what can I do if I still want you  
  
If we could start over again  
I know if we try our love could be stronger  
If we could start over again  
I'm sure, we oh  
We'd never have to let go  
  
For so many years now  
I've held inside things I meant to say  
But faced with the past now I realize  
I can't let that stand in our way  
  
I never knew that a love so strong would never fade  
But what can we do  
If I still want you  
And you want me too  
  
How can we walk away  
From something that was once so strong  
Have we the strength to say we're wrong



This is not love  
This is not even worth a point of view  
In Echo Park I  
Pause for effect  
And whisper 'Who are you?'  
  
They crawl out of their holes for me  
And I die : You die  
Hear them laugh  
And watch them turn on me  
And I die : You die  
See my scars  
They call me such things  
Tear me, tear me, tear me  
  
But I have your names  
Screaming 'You will suffer'  
And, 'You're all too late'  
Now I feel young  
Does everything stop when the old tape fails?  
  
They crawl out of their holes for me  
And I die, you die  
Hear them laugh  
And watch them turn on me  
And I die, you die  
See my scars  
They call me such things  
Tear me, tear me, tear me  
  
But I'm still frightened by the telephone.



Now Jerry was no architect  
But she sure knew how to put out all the lights  
I once watched her walk right  
Through a plate glass window  
And never even look hack  
Now here I am talking about all her good points  
I never did think she had any bad  
Though friends told me she could be cruel  
And vicious  
At one time she was the best friend that I had  
And I hope she can hear  
I hope she feels good  
I hope she was the best or everything  
And I hope she feels like a million dollars  
And I hope she knows I was always honest  
Now Jerry was a main-line angel  
She never came home at night  
She slept where the wind would take her  
In her P. V. C thigh length boots  
Make-up black and solid  
Fingernails bitten by teeth so close  
To perfection only marred by  
Seven years of obvious fake prescriptions  
That were one way or making  
Sure that she never saw the daylight  
Before wearing her sunglasses over  
Breakfast with her Italian girlfriend  
In a post blitz kid stupor  
Saying "How ya doin', Davy boy"  
You know you're such a trooper  
And I hope you feel good  
And I hope you feel like a million dollars  
And I hope you know that I was  
Always.... Honest



As the time slips through your fingers  
Till it's almost time to go  
And the morning breaks between us  
And the ice melts into snow.  
I'm alright loving you  
I'm alright loving you  
  
Love and other bruises didn't have to choose us  
But it did and I'm alive and I'm trying to survive  
Love and other bruises makes us all good losers  
I can't help it talking loud it's because I'm on a cloud.  
Won't you please take me home  
Won't you please please take me home  
I'm so mixed up over you  
I don't want to be alone.  
I'm alright loving you  
I'm alright loving you



The wild mountain thyme that grows around my door  
Has grown there for two score years or more  
But I've grown weary waiting for love to say,  
"Come my way, come my way."  
The brook that sings and twinkles in the sun  
Has danced this mercy bounce since time begun  
But O how weary and how long the day  
Will he say, "Come my way."  
Lovers all around, I wish you joy,  
Happiness to every girl and boy.  
But sometimes spare a thought of me and say  
"Love come her way," come my way.  
  



Ooh...  
Crossing the ocean with my window view  
Thinkin' of the time I spent with you  
And I close my eyes and I see the family  
Thinkin' of their wish list  
All dressed up for Christmas  
On my own for too many years  
I miss the happiness, I miss the tears  
  
When I close my eyes and I'm all alone  
And I think of all the love we shared  
When I need a friend or a helping hand  
I know that you will all be there  
I've been gone for so many holidays  
But you can light the fire  
'Cause this year  
I'll be home for Christmas Day  
  
I see the children playing in the snow  
Precious memories that I used to know  
And I see the love in the mothers' eyes  
Always there to teach us  
The real meaning of Christmas  
On my own for too many years  
I missed the happiness, I miss the tears  
  
When I close my eyes and I'm all alone  
And I think of all the love we shared  
When I need a friend or a helping hand  
I know that you will all be there  
I've been gone for so many holidays  
But you can light the fire  
'Cause this year  
I'll be home for Christmas Day  
  
It doesn't matter  
How old you think you are  
Something happens to you  
When you see that shining star  
  
When I close my eyes and I'm all alone  
And I think of all the love we shared  
When I need a friend or a helping hand  
I know that you will all be there  
I've been gone for so many holidays  
But you can light the fire  
'Cause this year  
I'll be home for Christmas Day  
  
When I close my eyes and I'm all alone  
And I think of all the love we shared  
When I need a friend or a helping hand  
I know that you will all be there  
I've been gone for so many holidays  
But you can light the fire, I'm sending out this wire  
'Cause this year  
I'll be home for Christmas  
Yeah...  
I'm coming home...



Oh, whoa no I can't pretend to tell you lies  
The heat that's burnin' thru' my veins  
Will eat your love alive  
Cos I-Yes I'm the devil in disguise  
The will is strong, the flesh is weak  
You see it in my eyes  
  
Call me-me the Manimal  
That's what I am  
Call me-me the Manimal  
Half beast half man  
Call me-me the Manimal  
That's what I am  
Call me-me the Manimal,  
Half beast half man  
  
Oh, whoa no temptation's fever's burnin' me  
My hands will sweat, my lips will scream  
I take just what I need  
Cos I-I wanna run my hands on you  
My soul's alive, I feel the drive  
The sweetmeat's where I feed  
  
Call me-me the Manimal  
That's what I am  
Call me-me the Manimal  
Half beast half man  
Call me-me the Manimal  
That's what I am  
Call me-me the Manimal  
Half beast half man  
  
Call of the wild I'm a lunatic child  
I wait in the bush, I watch you and smile  
Dinner's at eight, I can't hardly wait  
I'll eat you alive, baby don't you be late  
  
Call me-me the Manimal  
That's what I am  
Call me-me the Manimal  
Half beast half man  
Call me-me the Manimal  
That's what I am  
Call me-me the Manimal  
Half beast half man



Do do do do doot  
Do do do do doot  
Do do do do doot  
You got to have rock love  
To weather the storm  
It's got to be rock love  
To help you carry on  
When the winds of temptation move your soul  
Stay with me now, don't you let it go  
I told you so  
Rock love will weather the storm  
You got to have rock love to hear your song  
It's got to be rock love, yeah  
To make you strong  
When everybody puts you down  
The rock of love will be around  
It's solid ground  
Rock love will weather the storm  
Rock love, yeah, will help you carry on  
Sweet Jesus will see you through  
Your trials, tribulations too  
No matter how far you go  
Still I will love you so  
I told you so  
Rock love will weather the storm  
Yeah  
  



Please excuse, my tendency  
To color everything I tell you  
You don't understand  
It takes me wherever I want to go  
  
This is surely what I need  
But I don't always think that way  
And in the end  
I can't help feeling  
  
I must sober into this  
I've got time  
To build you up so tall  
You won't fall down on me  
  
I've got time  
To build you up so tall  
You won't fall down on me, down on me  
Please excuse  
  
My tendency  
To color everything I tell you  
But in my mind  
There's nothing that really  
  
Ever holds us from the truth  
So I build My Ark for you  
And I hope you do the same for me  
In the end, I can't feeling  
  
Just a sobering end to this  
I've got time  
To build you up so tall  
You won't fall down on me  
  
I've got time  
To build you up so tall  
You won't fall down on me, down on me



The song is over  
It's all behind me  
I should have known it  
She tried to find me  
  
Our love is over  
They're all ahead now  
I've got to learn it  
I'm gonna to sing out  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces  
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free  
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces  
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free  
  
When I walked in through the door  
Thought it was me I was looking for  
She was the first song I ever sang  
But it stopped as soon as it began  
  
Our love is over  
It's all behind me  
They're all ahead now  
Can't hope to find me  
  
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces  
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free  
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces  
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea  
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains  
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free  
  
This song is over  
I'm left with only tears  
I must remember  
Even if it takes a million years  
  
The song is over  
The song is over  
  
Searchin' for a note, pure and easy  
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by



Ikaw ang bigay ng maykapal  
Tugon sa aking dasal  
Upang sa lahat ng panahon  
Bawat pagkakataon  
Ang ibigin ay ikaw  
  
Ikaw ang tanglaw sa aking mundo  
Kabiyak nitong puso ko  
Wala ni kahati mang saglit  
Na sa iyo'why may papalit  
Ngayo't kailanma'why ikaw  
  
Ang lahat ng aking galaw  
Ang sanhi ay ikaw  
Kung may bukas mang tinatanaw  
Dahil may isang ikaw  
Kulang ang magpakailanpaman  
Upang bawat sandali ay  
Upang muli't muli ay  
Ang mahalin ay ikaw



(lead vocal - david paton)  
  
You don't fool me with your tinted eyes and make-up  
The firebird hides in shadow when you wake up  
Your golden hair is black  
Your jeans are tight but your hide is slack  
Try it on the company but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
I'd rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
You don't fool me with your easy lies and fables  
You won't see me in ten buck furs and sables  
You sparkle like a snake  
The wine is real but the glass if fake  
Blame it on the apple tree but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
I'd rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
Your golden hair is black  
Your jeans are tight but your hide is slack  
Try it on the company but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
I'd rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
I'd rather be a man cause I wouldn't wanna be like you



Gone stray we find ourselves  
Right on the edge of falling apart  
Don't you see it's in our ways  
When something's done wrong, we just go along  
It lights a fire inside of me  
Just show me when this living stops  
  
I am father and son  
I am all that I fear  
I can choose to give up  
We could tear the world apart  
Tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart  
  
Cut the cord start to breathe  
We're living life at frantic speed  
Don the suit and ride the steed  
With these shackles on you won't come to harm  
I could be the worst of these  
A sinking ship on the open sea  
  
I am father and son  
I am all that I fear  
I can choose to give up  
We could tear the world apart  
Tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart  
  
All on my own I'm trying  
To change how you see and what you believe  
To fight fire with fire and live eye for eye  
We'll all end up blind and burning  
Burning, burning  
  
Tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart  
We could tear the world apart



On the stairs she sits and waits  
She's crying out but nobody even cares  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Holding in the hurt and pain  
Looking for love to come pull her from this place  
(Pull her from this place)  
  
I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence  
I'm not gonna walk away in silence  
  
Sometimes we're loudest when  
The doors are shut and no one can see our face  
(No one can see our face)  
But it seems we're quiet when  
Someone needs a touch of heaven's grace, oh yeah  
  
I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence  
I'm not gonna walk away in silence  
  
We are all God's children  
We need to count off all we've been given, oh yeah  
We are all God's children  
We need to tell off all we've been given, oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
I'm not gonna sit and stay  
I'm not gonna walk away  
  
I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence  
I'm not gonna walk away in silence, yeah, in silence  
I'm not gonna walk away in silence



I been hangin' round this place, I been lookin' through your space  
I been waitin' for you, I've been waitin' for you  
All the places that you go, all the people that you know  
I've been lookin' for you, I've been lookin' for you  
  
And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place  
They all got somethin' in their pockets, all got somethin' on their face  
They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard  
Singin' hallelujah while they dance over the stars  
They all say they're goin' far  
  
Me I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
All night long, all night long, all night long  
  
Somebody said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land  
So I've been out here all night lookin' for your footprints in the sand  
Did you hear the ocean singing, baby did you sing along  
While you danced out in the water to some ol' forgotten song,  
Were you even here at all?  
  
Me I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
All night long, all night long, all night long  
  
Somehow I wound up in the desert just after daylight  
Where the Joshua Trees grow that little place you always liked  
These pioneer town people ain't got too much to say  
And if you ever were here baby they ain't givin' you away  
  
Now it's been two days  
I'm still lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
I've been lookin' for you baby, I've been lookin' for you baby  
All night long, all night long, all night long  
  
And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place  
They all got somethin' in their pockets, all got somethin' on their face  
  
Somebody said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land  
So I've been out here all night lookin' for your footprints in the sand  
  
Think I'll go back to the city, back to El Cerrito Place  
That's the last time I saw that pretty smile upon your face  
I've been lookin' for you baby



Dry your eyes, and take your song out, it's a newborn afternoon.  
If you can't recall the singer, you can still recall the tune.  
Dry your eyes and play it slowly, like you're marching off to war,  
Sing it like you know he'd want it, like we sang it once before.  
  
From the center of the circle to the midst of the waving crowd.  
If it ever be forgotten, sing it long and sing it loud.  
Come, dry your eyes.  
And he taught us more about giving than we ever cared to know.  
  
But we came to find the secret and we never let it go.  
And it was more than being holy, though it was less than being free,  
And if you can't recall the reason, can you hear the people sing,  
Through the lightning and the thunder, to the dark side of the moon,  
  
To that distant calling angel who descended much too soon.  
And come, dry your eyes.  
  
Come, dry your eyes.



Oh it's twelve o'clock  
On the old grey wall  
Yet another year  
'75 is here  
  
I hear all the people celebrating  
Another year  
Oh Darkness, darkness  
Inside my head  
  
I'm on my own again  
That's what I think I said  
This place is just a one-horse town  
So let the rain fall down  
  
Year and year again  
I'll be sitting here reflecting  
How nothing's changed  
But am I still the same  
  
People blow up all around me  
Yet I remain  
Nothing's changed  
Another day begins  
  
The same old same again  
It's like some movie scene  
I know it all frame by frame  
I'll try to figure out what it means  
  
Some other day  
Now my diary  
Is looking back at me  
Oh it's another year  
  
'76 is here  
I'm watching all the people celebrating  
Another year  
It's another year  
  
Another year  
Another year



No good man  
Loving on a no good plan never treats me as he should  
And that ain't good he's always bringing me down  
He's no saint Heaven knows that's what he ain't  
Spends his money foolishly and not on me  
I'm the one who gets the run around  
  
I ought to hate him but still I love him so  
Cos I require love that's made of fire  
And in his arms I find always get that kind  
No good man  
Ever since the world began there's been other folks like me  
Born to be in love with a no good man  
  
I ought to hate him but still I love him so  
Cos you see I require love that's made of fire  
And in his arms I find always get that kind  
No good man  
Ever since the world began there's been other folks like me  
Born to be in love with a no good man



So tell me if you really want to be a superstar  
But fiesta on the mike and will surely take you far  
You made that drop on the 24 tracks  
We mix it all down then we put on wax  
  
Beginning is hyped when you playin in the bars  
A bottomless pit where you make loose and far  
Take away your privacy and take your guitar  
Then take your woman and impound your car  
  
My beginning of wisdom I won't take you too far  
First you gotta sell your soul to be a superstar  
Baby if you got it forget about that  
Your money don't concern you that's a natural fact  
  
Shut up your mouth before you get knocked down  
We're gonna listen to your voice upon the speaker box  
First you get a manager but what does he do  
I'll be the first to tell you baby that I don't have a clue  
  
We're gunna make a phony image for the MTV  
Hear it on the radio say damn that's me  
Whenever I get over on a 3 piece hog  
Jesus and her mom are gonna break your arm  
  
Put your ass in the john to be a superstar  
I realize sometimes I feel old design  
Oh your reknown position and you just can't hide  
Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff  
  
All over the world you gotta take that trip  
And then you never thought you'd see the day you'd act like this  
Your rep is getting bigger than a B-52  
And then it goes around the world before it gets back to you  
  
Hey our love has started can you believe  
Before your eyes this shit just come back to me  
Oh my God I take a rest on the side  
So long so long so long so long I'll see ya  
  
Oh my God if I'd a let my own  
I'd take it turn around and place it home  
I realize sometimes I feel old design  
Oh your renowned position and you just can't hide  
  
Whoa it's the position  
I just can't hide  
Bo  
Whatcha want whatcha need  
  
Give it a bunch of mine and you just can't miss  
Your love feels like this  
Some people love get your shit like this  
Well if you love wad up your love punani punani  
  
Whoa if you love me punani punani  
Oh my God  
Free yeah free oh oh oh hey  
Want the dogs? Let em go. Let em



Some of them were dreamers  
And some of them were fools  
Who were making plans and thinking of the future  
With the energy of the innocent  
They were gathering the tools  
They would need to make their journey back to nature  
While the sand slipped through the opening  
And their hands reached for the golden ring  
With their hearts they turned to each other's hearts for refuge  
In the troubled years that came before the deluge  
  
Some of them knew pleasure  
And some of them knew pain  
And for some of them it was only the moment that mattered  
And on the brave and crazy wings of youth  
They went flying around in the rain  
And their feathers, once so fine, grew torn and tattered  
And in the end they traded their tired wings  
For the resignation that living brings  
And exchanged love's bright and fragile glow  
For the glitter and the rouge  
And in a moment they were swept before the deluge  
  
Let the music keep our spirits high  
Let the buildings keep our children dry  
Let creation reveal its secrets by and by, by and by  
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky  
  
Some of them were angry  
At the way the earth was abused  
By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power  
And they struggled to protect her from them  
Only to be confused  
By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour  
And when the sand was gone and the time arrived  
In the naked dawn only a few survived  
And in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge  
Believed that they were meant to live after the deluge  
  
Let the music keep our spirits high  
Let the buildings keep our children dry  
Let creation reveal it's secrets by and by, by and by  
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky



Oceans apart and with only the blue between  
Since we're apart  
I'm yearning  
I tell my heart  
We must wait for another dawn  
When he may be returning  
How I regret the night he sailed for another shore  
Will he come into sight to leave my arms no more?  
I'll kiss him again  
He'll know right from the very start  
That we were never meant to be oceans apart  
Oceans apart and with only the blue between us  
Since we're apart  
I'm yearning  
I'll kiss him again  
He'll know right from the very start  
That we were never meant to be oceans apart.

When tears are in your eyes,  
And you can't find the way.  
  
It's hard to make believe,  
You're happy when you're gray.  
  
Baby when you're feelin' like,  
You'll never see the mornin' light.  
  
Come to me,

To help the shadows drift away.

Who's gonna love you?



My latest sun is sinking fast, my race is nearly run  
My strongest trials now are past, my triumph has begun  
Oh, come angel band come and around me stand  
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home  
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home  
Oh bear my longing heart to him who bled and died for me  
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin and gives me victory  
Oh, come angel band come and around me stand  
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home  
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home  



I gotta stay in the race  
The die has been cast  
That's the way I'm going  
I tried to jump the river  
That flows so fast  
But it just keeps flowing  
  
It's a hell of a journey  
And I just can't wait  
There's no way I can hide it  
But it's a killer of a storm  
And it looks like rain  
I guess I've got to ride it  
  
Sometimes I can't keep my feet on the ground  
I can't let go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I can't let go, it's all that I know  
  
Ain't no question if you win or lose  
Whether it's cold or rainy  
Gotta find my place whatever I choose  
Never Say if or maybe  
And there's so many turns that I can see  
In a world that I'm no stranger  
I'm in the race and now I can't turn back  
Survive in the face of danger  
  
Sometimes I can't keep my feet on the ground  
I can't let go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I can't let go, it's all that I know  
  
Sometimes I can't keep my feet on the ground  
I can't go  
My world is spinning just like the speed of sound  
I can't let go, it's all that I know



You don't understand, you don't understand  
What you do to me when you hold his hand  
We were meant to be but a twist of fate  
Made it so you had to walk away  
  
'Cause we're on fire  
We are on fire  
We're on fire now  
Yeah, we're on fire  
We are on fire  
We're on fire now  
  
I don't care what people say when we're together  
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep  
I just want it to be you and I forever  
I know you wanna leave  
So c'mon baby be with me  
So happily  
  
It's four a.m. and I know that you're with him  
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin  
And if he feels my traces in your hair  
Sorry, love, but I don't really care  
  
'Cause we're on fire  
We are on fire  
We're on fire now  
Yeah, we're on fire  
We are on fire  
We're on fire now  
  
I don't care what people say when we're together  
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep  
I just want it to be you and I forever  
I know you wanna leave  
So c'mon baby be with me  
So happily  
  
So happily  
One, two, three, four!  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
We're on fire now (we're on fire)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
We're on fire now  
  
I don't care what people say when we're together  
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep  
I just want it to be you and I forever  
I know you wanna leave  
So c'mon baby be with me  
So happily  
  
I don't care what people say when we're together  
You know I wanna be the one to hold you when you sleep  
I just want it to be you and I forever  
I know you wanna leave  
So c'mon baby be with me  
So happily



Angels and sailors  
Rich girls  
Backyard fences  
Tents  
Dreams watching each other narrowly  
Soft luxuriant cars  
Girls in garages, stripped  
Out to get liquor and clothes  
Half gallons of wine and six-packs of beer  
Jumped, humped, born to suffer  
Made to undress in the wilderness.  
I will never treat you mean  
Never start no kind of scene  
I'll tell you every place and person that I've been.  
Always a playground instructor, never a killer  
Always a bridesmaid on the verge of fame or over  
He maneuvered two girls into his hotel room  
One a friend, the other, the young one, a newer stranger  
Vaguely Mexican or Puerto Rican  
Poor boys thighs and buttock scarred by a father's belt  
She's trying to rise  
Story of her boyfriend, of teenage stoned death games  
Handsome lad, dead in a car  
Confusion  
No connections  
Come 'ere  
I love you  
Peace on earth  
Will you die for me?  
Eat me  
This way  
The end  
I'll always be true  
Never go out, sneaking out on you, babe  
If you'll only show me Far Arden again.  
I'm surprised you could get it up  
He whips her lightly, sardonically, with belt  
Haven't I been through enough? she asks  
Now dressed and leaving  
The Spanish girl begins to bleed  
She says her period  
It's Catholic heaven  
I have an ancient Indian crucifix around my neck  
My chest is hard and brown  
Lying on stained, wretched sheets with a bleeding virgin  
We could plan a murder  
Or start a religion.



She got the keys, she's got the keys  
She got the keys, what's she gonna do with the keys?  
  
I'm gonna lock my heart and throw away the key  
I'm wise to all those tricks you played on me  
I'm gonna turn my back on love, gonna snub the moon above  
Seal all my windows up with tin so the love bug can't get in  
  
I'm gonna park my romance right alone the curb  
Hang a sign upon my heart, ''Please don't disturb''  
And if I never fall in love again that's soon enough for me  
I'm gonna lock my heart and throw the key  
  
She's gonna lock her heart and throw away the key  
(Gonna lock my heart)  
I'm wise to all those tricks you've played on me  
She's gonna turn her back on love, gonna snub the moon above  
Seal all my windows up with tin so the love bug can't get in  
  
I'm gonna park my romance right alone the curb  
Hang a sign upon my heart, "Please don't disturb"  
And if I never fall in love again that's soon enough for me  
(Don't make it too soon)  
I'm gonna lock my heart  
(She's gonna lock her heart)  
And throw away the key  
(She's gonna lock her heart and throw away the key)



I had a dream I was moving forward  
Floating gently to the sun  
I've come to see my world rewarded  
A new day has begun  
  
A lost bird caught in mid migration  
Far away to a foreign land  
Offspring of a secret nation  
A new day has begun  
  
[Chorus]  
I can see the earth below me  
And I can  
Feel it turn  
  
Fog lifts to reveal potential  
For generations prophesied  
Our growth to be exponential  
Our promise finally realized  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feel it turn  
Across the sky  
The world it learns  
So must I  
  
Cut steel wired into water  
Fixed link, circumnavigate  
Old men see your sons and daughters  
No longer, no longer hesitate  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]



Taking over, assisting with my revelation  
Empty spaces, as if it was an invitation  
Your invasion, exceeding every expectation  
Now I feed from the many mouths of your persuasion  
Resurrection, infection, as I fade away  
There's no fear, there is nothing left to make me stay  
Fitting in my new skin, just tell me what to do  
I'm defined, I am blind, I am a part of you  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Big black bomb, attack  
Break down resist us, fight back  
Now I am a part of you, attack  
Now I am a part of you, resist us, fight back  
Now I am a part of you, attack  
Now I am a part of you, resist us, fight back



One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, out  
Everyone is waiting for the light  
Be afraid, don't be afraid  
The sun is shining out of my eyes  
It will not set tonight  
And the world counts loudly to ten  
One  
Here comes the sun  
Two  
Here comes the sun  
Three  
It is the brightest star of them all  
Four  
Here comes the sun  
The sun is shining out of my hands  
It can burn, it can blind you all  
When it breaks out of the fists  
It lays down hotly on the face  
It will not set tonight  
And the world counts loudly to ten  
One  
Here comes the sun  
Two  
Here comes the sun  
Three  
It is the brightest star of them all  
Four  
Here comes the sun  
Five  
Here comes the sun  
Six  
Here comes the sun  
Seven  
It is the brightest star of them all  
Eight, nine  
Here comes the sun  
The sun is shining out of my hands  
It can burn, it can blind you  
When it breaks out of the fists  
It lays down hotly on your face  
It lays down painfully on your chest  
Balance is lost  
It lets you go hard to the floor  
And the world counts loudly to ten  
One  
Here comes the sun  
Two  
Here comes the sun  
Three  
It is the brightest star of them all  
Four  
And it will never fall from the sky  
Five  
Here comes the sun  
Six  
Here comes the sun  
Seven  
It is the brightest star of them all  
Eight, nine  
Here comes the sun



All dressed in uniforms so fine,  
They drank and killed to pass the time,  
Wearing the shame of all their crimes,  
With measured steps, they walked in line.  
  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line.  
  
They carried pictures of their wives,  
And numbered tags to prove their lives,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line.  
  
Full of a glory never seen,  
They made it through the whole machine,  
To never question anymore,  
Hypnotic trance, they never saw,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
They walked in line,  
Walked in line,  
Walked in line.



Hey!  
Look what you have done.  
Showing me the sun,  
And now it's shining through.  
It's nice to be with you.  
  
Hey!  
I like the things you say,  
And I like the way  
You do the things you do.  
It's nice to be with you.  
  
Each time that I give my heart to someone new,  
They just turn it blue.  
But this time  
Is my time,  
And my time  
Is all the time I have  
To be with you.  
So, please  
Never go away.  
Say you're going to stay,  
And make my dreams come true.  
It's nice to be with you.  
  
Each time that I give my heart to someone new,  
They just turn it blue.  
But this time  
Is my time,  
And my time  
Is all the time I have  
To be with you.  
So, please  
Never go away.  
Say you're going to stay,  
And make my dreams come true.  
It's nice to be with you.



Hey, I can see all your dreams  
Lying scattered in your fragile heart  
You think your world's come apart  
But hey, I believe there's gonna be  
  
A brighter day that shines for you my friend  
It's waiting around the bend  
You've been dancing on the wire  
Walking through the fire  
  
Thinking you're all alone  
But you're not on your owe  
There's a faithful hand to guide you  
God always be beside you  
  
All because he is love  
And love won't leave you now  
So fly, on the wings of your dreams  
To the place he is taking you  
  
You're gonna make it through  
And, if you doubt. Just think about  
All the promises that he has made  
You don't have to be afraid  
  
Through the smiles, through the sorrow  
He was faithful yesterday, and he'll be faithful tomorrow.



When I jumped off, I had a bucket full of thoughts  
When I first jumped off, I held that bucket in my hand  
Ideas that would take me all around the world  
I stood and watched the smoke behind the mountain curl  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
  
Now I'm gone and I'll never look back again  
I'm gone and I'll never look back at all  
You know I'll never look back again  
I turn my face into the howlin' wind  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
  
See my face in the town that's flashing by  
See me standing at the station in the rain  
See me running there beside the car  
I left it all behind, again I'll travel far  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
  
When I jumped off, I had a bucket full of thoughts  
When I first jumped off, I held that bucket in my hand  
Ideas that would take me all around the world  
I stood and watched the smoke behind the mountains curl  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
It took me a long time to get back on the train  
It took me a long time to get back on the train



The moment I wake up  
Before I put on my makeup  
I say a little prayer for you  
While combing my hair now  
And wondering what dress to wear now  
I say a little prayer for you  
  
Forever and ever  
You'll stay in my heart  
And I will love you  
Forever and ever  
We never will part  
Oh how I'll love you  
Together, forever  
That's how it will be  
To live without you  
Would only mean heartbreak for me  
  
I run for the bus dear  
While riding it I think of us dear  
I say a little prayer for you  
At work I just take time  
And all through my coffee break time  
I say a little prayer for you  
  
Forever and ever  
You'll stay in my heart  
And I will love you  
Forever and ever  
We never will part  
Oh how I'll love you  
Together, forever  
That's how it will be  
To live without you  
Would only mean heartbreak for me  
  
My darling believe me  
For me there is no one  
But you  
Please love me too  
I'm in love with you  
Answer my prayer  
  
Forever and ever  
You'll stay in my heart  
And I will love you  
Forever and ever  
We never will part  
Oh how I'll love you  
Together, forever  
That's how it will be  
To live without you  
Would only mean heartbreak for me



The sand, feel the waves between your toes  
Can you feel the way the old wind blows  
From one to another  
Here to discover  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Honeysuckle vines outside the door  
Dandelion wine and so much more  
We can discover  
Into each other  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Night fall, fireflies light up the lawn  
Pink skies mirrored on the sea at dawn  
From one to another  
Here to discover  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  



Almost there, we're almost there  
How wonderful, wonderful our love will be  
For you, for me  
  
We're almost there where we will share  
A warm caress, tenderness, a dream come true  
For me, for you  
  
Love has waited such a long time  
Now we're a kiss apart  
Darling, this is the right time  
To let the kisses start  
  
For you're almost mine and soon we'll find  
Our paradise, paradise so rare  
Close your eyes for we're almost there  
  
You're almost mine and soon we'll find  
Our paradise, paradise so rare  
Close your eyes, close your eyes  
Close your eyes for we're almost there  
Almost there  
Almost there



While no one was looking on the old plantation  
He took her all the way down the long valley road  
They sent her away not too much later  
Left him walking down the old valley road.  
  
Sometimes i lead, sometimes i follow  
This time i'll go where she wants me to go  
She said maybe today, maybe tomorrow  
Go deep in the woods down the long valley road  
  
Walk on walk on little doll walk  
Walk on little doll  
  
Out in the hall they were talkin' in a whisper  
Everybody noticed she was gone a while  
Somebody said she was gone to her sister's  
Everyone knew what they were talkin' about.  
  
While no one was looking on the old plantation  
He showed her what they do down the long valley road  
Came back around like nothin' really happened  
Left him standing on the old valley road  
  
Walk on walk on little doll walk on  
Walk on little doll  
Walk on, walk on the valley road  
  
Standing like a stone on the old plantation  
Rich old man wouldn't ever let him in  
Good enough to hire, not good enough to marry  
When it all happens, nobody wins  
Walk on walk on little doll walk on  
Walkon little doll etc



Hey baby I'm here to tell you about yourself  
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, scratchin' all the time  
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog baby, scratchin' all the time  
You ain't caught no rabbits you ain't no friend of mine  
Well, you said you was high class  
Found out that was just a lie  
Yeah you said you was high class, baby  
That was just a lie  
Well, you ain't killed no rabbits, you ain't no friend of mine  
  
Hey you ain't nothin' but a hond dog, scratchin' all the time  
You ain't nothin' but a hond dog boby, scratchin' all the time
